<p>HPE Helion OpenStack(R) uses security groups and security rules to control access to instances in your cloud.</p>
<p>You can use the dashboards to create, delete and configure security groups and security group rules to control access to your instance</p>
<p>How you interact with your network environment depends upon your user type, either an administrative user (admin) or a non-administrative user (user).</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The admin can perform all of the user tasks in addition to the admin tasks.</p>
