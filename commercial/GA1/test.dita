  <p>To get a better idea of what's inside the box, explore the individual components and how they work together <xref href="ServicesFlow/index.html"  >under the hood</xref>.</p>
</section>
<section id="TripleO"> <title>What is TripleO?</title>
<p>OpenStack-on-OpenStack or TripleO, is an official  OpenStack project for deployment of OpenStack systems. It builds on the core resource-provisioning strengths of OpenStack technology. It enables you to administer your cloud or deploy and maintain virtual and baremetal installations of OpenStack using the same APIs you are familiar with for deploying workloads on an OpenStack cloud. A template-based deployment engine (using OpenStack Heat) allows for rigorous testing and reliable, repeatable deployments of known configurations.</p>
<p>A TripleO installation includes a <xref type="section" href="#topic7707/whatisseed">seed</xref>, the <xref type="section" href="#topic7707/whatisundercloud">undercloud</xref> and the <xref type="section" href="#topic7707/whatisovercloud">overcloud</xref>.</p>
</section>
<section id="whatisseed"> <title>What is a seed?</title>
<p>A seed VM is a bootable KVM VM image provided as part of HP Helion OpenStack and is deployed in a VM instance. This instance provisions physical hardware and deploys the undercloud. It also contains the minimum services required for OpenStack to function: Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone, Ironic &amp; Heat.</p>
<p>This is the first phase of the HP Helion OpenStack installation.</p>
</section>
<section id="whatisundercloud"> <title>What is the undercloud?</title>
<p>The undercloud server is a basic single-node OpenStack installation running on a single physical server used to deploy, test, manage, and update the overcloud servers. There is no HA configuration for the undercloud.</p>
<p>The undercloud contains a strictly limited sub-set of services; just enough to interact with the overcloud. The services running on the undercloud are Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone, Ironic, Heat, Horizon &amp; Ceilometer. This server also contains the HP Helion content distribution catalog service, which provides a mechanism for downloading and installing content and updates for the overcloud.</p>
<p>The undercloud also hosts images for various server types which will form the functional cloud environment - the <xref type="section" href="#topic7707/whatisovercloud">overcloud</xref>. These images are overcloud Controller, overcloud Compute, overcloud Swift &amp; overcloud Compute Proxy (required for clouds that support VMWare ESX as a hypervisor).</p>
<p>Creating the undercloud is the second phase of the HP Helion installation process.</p>
</section>
<section id="whatisovercloud"> <title>What is the overcloud?</title>
<p>The overcloud is the functional cloud available to run guest virtual machines and workloads. It offers access to the Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone, Cinder, Swift, Ironic, Heat, Horizon, and Ceilometer services.</p>
<p>Creating and configuring the overcloud completes the overall Helion OpenStack installation process.</p>
</section>
<section id="hybridorpubliccloud"> <title>Does HP Helion OpenStack work with hybrid or public cloud projects?</title>
<p>Absolutely. HP Helion provides a proven hybrid IT strategy that enables migration of existing traditional IT workloads to appropriate cloud environments at the pace and volume that makes sense for your enterprise.</p>
