</section>
<section id="TripleO"> <title>What is TripleO?</title>
<p>OpenStack(R)-on-OpenStack(R) or TripleO, is an official  OpenStack(R) project for deployment of OpenStack(R) systems. It builds on the core resource-provisioning strengths of OpenStack(R) technology. It enables you to administer your cloud or deploy and maintain virtual and baremetal installations of OpenStack(R) using the same APIs you are familiar with for deploying workloads on an OpenStack(R) cloud. A template-based deployment engine (using OpenStack(R) Heat) allows for rigorous testing and reliable, repeatable deployments of known configurations.</p>
<p>A TripleO installation includes a <xref type="section" href="#topic7707/whatisseed">seed</xref>, the <xref type="section" href="#topic7707/whatisundercloud">undercloud</xref> and the <xref type="section" href="#topic7707/whatisovercloud">overcloud</xref>.</p>
</section>
<section id="whatisseed"> <title>What is a seed?</title>
<p>A seed VM is a bootable KVM VM image provided as part of HPE Helion OpenStack(R) and is deployed in a VM instance. This instance provisions physical hardware and deploys the undercloud. It also contains the minimum services required for OpenStack(R) to function: Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone, Ironic &amp; Heat.</p>
<p>This is the first phase of the HPE Helion OpenStack(R) installation.</p>
</section>
<section id="whatisundercloud"> <title>What is the undercloud?</title>
<p>The undercloud server is a basic single-node OpenStack(R) installation running on a single physical server used to deploy, test, manage, and update the overcloud servers. There is no HA configuration for the undercloud.</p>
<p>The undercloud contains a strictly limited sub-set of services; just enough to interact with the overcloud. The services running on the undercloud are Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone, Ironic, Heat, Horizon &amp; Ceilometer. This server also contains the HPE Helion content distribution catalog service, which provides a mechanism for downloading and installing content and updates for the overcloud.</p>
<p>The undercloud also hosts images for various server types which will form the functional cloud environment - the <xref type="section" href="#topic7707/whatisovercloud">overcloud</xref>. These images are overcloud Controller, overcloud Compute, overcloud Swift &amp; overcloud Compute Proxy (required for clouds that support VMWare ESX as a hypervisor).</p>
<p>Creating the undercloud is the second phase of the HPE Helion installation process.</p>
</section>
<section id="whatisovercloud"> <title>What is the overcloud?</title>
<p>The overcloud is the functional cloud available to run guest virtual machines and workloads. It offers access to the Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone, Cinder, Swift, Ironic, Heat, Horizon, and Ceilometer services.</p>
<p>Creating and configuring the overcloud completes the overall Helion OpenStack(R) installation process.</p>
</section>
<section id="hybridorpubliccloud"> <title>Does HPE Helion OpenStack(R) work with hybrid or public cloud projects?</title>
<p>Absolutely. HPE Helion provides a proven hybrid IT strategy that enables migration of existing traditional IT workloads to appropriate cloud environments at the pace and volume that makes sense for your enterprise.</p>
