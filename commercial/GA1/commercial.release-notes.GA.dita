<section id="known-issues"> <title>Known Issues in this Release</title>
<p>The following are the known issues for HPE <tm tmtype="reg">Helion OpenStack</tm></p>
<p>
  <b>Operations</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you determine that your VM seed has not started correctly when you execute the <codeph>hp_ced_start_seed</codeph> script, run the script a second time to ensure you start the seed.</li>
<li>
<p>If, for some reason, the overcloud controller is rebooted, the VMs might be in an ERROR state. Execute the following commands to restart the services and remove the error(s):</p>

<codeblock>
<codeph>$ sudo service nova-compute restart
$ sudo service nova-scheduler restart
$ sudo service nova-conductor restart
$ sudo service neutron-openvswitch-agent restart
</codeph>
</codeblock>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some instances, the centralized logging feature does not function after the  product installation. If this occurs, repeat the following steps on the overcloud controller and all compute nodes</p>

<codeblock>
<codeph>service rsyslog restart
</codeph>
</codeblock>
</li>
</ul>

<li>When a controller node crashes, it must be rebooted to return to its operational state.</li>
