<p>The following terms are common to Ceph. Ceph is a technology that integrates object, block, and file storage. It is integrated into Helion OpenStack 1.1 and 1.1.1 cloud environments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cephx - The Ceph authentication protocol. Cephx operates like Kerberos, and it has no single point of failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ceph Stack - A collection of two or more components of Ceph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ceph Node [ Node, Host ] - Any single machine or server in a Ceph System.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cluster map - The set of maps comprising the monitor map, OSD map, PG map, MDS map and CRUSH map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ceph Block Storage - The block storage "product," service or capabilities when used in conjunction with librbd, a hypervisor such as QEMU or Xen, and a hypervisor abstraction layer such as libvirt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ceph OSD - The Ceph OSD software, which interacts with a logical disk(OSD). Sometimes, Ceph users use the term "OSD" to refer to "Ceph OSD Daemon", though the proper term is "Ceph OSD".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ceph Object Gateway [ RADOS Gateway, RGW ] - The S3/Swift gateway component of Ceph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ceph Metadata Server - MDS - The Ceph metadata software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ceph Client - The collection of Ceph components which can access a Ceph Storage Cluster. These include the Ceph Object Gateway, the Ceph Block Device, the Ceph Filesystem, and their corresponding libraries, kernel modules, and FUSEs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ceph Kernel Modules - The collection of kernel modules which can be used to interact with the Ceph System (e.g,. ceph.ko, rbd.ko).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ceph Client Libraries - The collection of libraries that can be used to interact with components of the Ceph System.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CRUSH - Controlled Replication Under Scalable Hashing. The algorithm Ceph uses to compute object storage locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epoch - Ceph maintains a history of each state change in the Ceph Monitors, Ceph OSD Daemons, and PGs. Each version of cluster element state is called an "epoch."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federated storage - A collection of autonomous storage resources with centralized management that provides rules about how data is stored, managed, and moved through the cluster. Multiple storage systems are combined and managed as a single storage pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HDN - <xref href="https://helion.hpwsportal.com" scope="external" format="html" >Helion Developer Network</xref>; a location where additional files or products can be downloaded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Object storage - A storage model focusing on data objects instead of file systems or disk blocks; objects have key/value pairs of metadata associated with them to give the data context. Typically accessed by a REST API, designed for massive scale, and using a wide, flat namespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PGs - Placement Group. A grouping of objects on an OSD; pools contain a number of PGs and many PGs can map to an OSD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pools - Logical partitions for storing objects. Pools set ownership/access to objects, the number of object replicas, the number of placement groups, and the CRUSH rule set to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RADOS - A Reliable, Autonomic Distributed Object Store. This is the core set of storage software that stores the user's data in a Ceph Cluster (MON+OSD).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RBD - The block storage component of Ceph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST - Representational State Transfer is stateless, cacheable, layered client-server architecture with a uniform interface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
