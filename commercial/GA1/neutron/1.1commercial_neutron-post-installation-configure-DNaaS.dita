# HPE Helion OpenStack&#174; 1.1: DNSaaS Configuration (Optional)

Configuring Domain Name System as a service (DNSaaS) is optional.

Our managed DNS service, based on the OpenStack Designate project, is engineered to help you create, publish, and manage your DNS zones and records securely and efficiently to either a public or private DNS server network. 

It is important to read through this page before starting your installation as it explains how to install and configure DNS as a service (DNSaaS) for HPE Helion OpenStack.

<p style="border-style: solid;"><b>Caution</b>: Before migrating to DNSaaS 1.01, you <b><i>must</i></b> first <a href="#uninstall">uninstall</a> DNSaaS 1.0. Do <b>not</b> attempt to install version 1.01 over the previous version. </p>

To configure DNSaaS review:

## Creating Prerequisite Credentials {#credentials}

You must create both **target** and **service** credentials.

###Target Credentials {#target-cred}
Target credentials are the credentials of the user+tenant where the service is to be deployed. Target credentials include a **tenant** and a **username**. Service credentials can only be created after the Target credentials have been successfully created.

* Create tenant
		
		$ keystone tenant-create --name dnsaas --description "DNSaaS Service" 

* Create username

		$ keystone user-create --name dnsaas --tenant dnsaas --email dnsaas@example.com --pass password

* Add role (this role is added for user)

		$ keystone user-role-add --user dnsaas --tenant dnsaas --role admin

###Service Credentials {#service-cred}
Service Credentials are credentials for the user+tenant used to validate end user tokens. Service credentials can only be created after the Target credentials have been successfully created. This user should be in the **service** tenant, have the **admin** and  **\_member_** roles, and be named **designate**.

- Create service credentials

		$ keystone user-create --name designate --tenant service --email designate@example.com --pass password

* Add admin role to service user command 

		$ keystone user-role-add --user designate --tenant service --role admin

##Installing and configuring DNSaaS {#configure}

**IMPORTANT**: During DNSaaS installation, non-deterministic failures within the infrastructure layer may cause the install to fail. If this occurs, DNSaaS installation should be retried up to two times.


1. SSH to install VM.

		$ ssh -i samplekey.pem debian@<Floating IP Address associated with the DNS Installer VM>


	<!--
	$ ssh debian@<Floating IP Address associated with the Installer Instance above> -->

	**Note**: Before you begin the installation, you must create a configuration file. You can do this by modifying the sample configuration file included with the DNSaaS installer files.

2. Create the SSH Public Key which is used by the Service VMs.

	It is recommended to use the same SSH key which was used to boot the installer VM. If you choose to use a different SSH key, please ensure you retain both SSH private keys for future use.

3. Copy the SSH Public Key. 

		$ cp .ssh/authorized_keys id_rsa.pub


4. Copy the sample configuration file to your home directory:

     	$ cp /etc/dnsaas-installer/dnsaas-installer.conf.sample ~/dnsaas-installer.conf

5. Edit your copy of the configuration file with the required changes:
 
    	$ nano dnsaas-installer.conf
		
   	A. DEFAULT section:

	   * auth&#095;url &#8212; Keystone auth URL
	   * target&#095;project&#095;name &#8212; Project name where the service is installed
	   * target&#095;username &#8212; Username used to deploy and run the service
	   * target&#095;region&#095;name &#8212; Region name to deploy the service in
	    
   	B. Designate section:

	   * ntp&#095;server &#8212; An IP or DNS name for an NTP server to sync time with
	   * database&#095;root&#095;password &#8212; Password for the database root user
	   * database&#095;designate&#095;password &#8212; Password for the database designate user
	   * database&#095;powerdns&#095;password &#8212; Password for the database powerdns user
	   * messaging&#095;root&#095;password &#8212; Password for the messaging root user
	   * messaging&#095;designate&#095;password &#8212; Password for the messaging designate user
	   * keystone&#095;host &#8212; Hostname or IP address of Keystone endpoint.
	  * service&#095;project &#8212; Project name for a user with permission to validate Keystone tokens
	  * service&#095;user &#8212; Username for a user with permission to validate Keystone tokens
	  * service&#095;password &#8212; Password for a user with permission to validate Keystone tokens
	  * backend&#095;driver &#8212; Backend driver to use (powerdns, dynect, akamai)

 	C. If you select MSDNS (Microsoft DNS Server) you must set the following options in the designate section:

	 * msdns&#095;servers: A comma separated list of the Microsoft DNS servers short hostnames
	 * messaging&#095;access&#095;cidr: A CIDR to allow inbound access from the Microsoft DNS servers


	D. If you select DynECT you must set the following options in the designate section:

	   * dynect&#095;customer&#095;name &#8212; Customer name provided by Dyn
	   *  dynect&#095;username &#8212; Username provided by Dyn
	   * dynect&#095;password &#8212; Password provided by Dyn


	E. If you select Akamai you must set the following options in the designate section:
	
	   * akamai_username: The username that was set up as part of your Akamai signup
	* akamai_password: The password that was set up as part of your Akamai signup
	

6. Run the installer validation command to verify the configuration file

     	 $ dnsaas-installer --target-password <Target User Password> validate

7. After you validate the configuration file, run the DNSaaS installer:

      	 $ dnsaas-installer --target-password <Target User Password> install



##Configure the Overcloud Load Balancer for DNSaaS {#configovercloud}

 You must configure HAProxy before you configure the overcloud Load Balance for DNaaS.

To configure HAProxy use the following command: 

	$ dnsaas-installer --target-password <Target User Password> haproxy

The HA Proxy configuration file will be displayed as the sample below:
	
	2014-09-17 23:31:05.670       INFO HAProxy configuration
	### START HAPROXY CONFIG
	listen designate
	  bind 0.0.0.0:9001
	  mode tcp
	  balance source
	  option tcpka
	  option tcplog
	   
	  server 10.22.171.32 10.22.171.32 check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 5
	  server 10.22.171.22 10.22.171.22 check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 5
	  server 10.22.171.21 10.22.171.21 check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 5
	### END HAPROXY CONFIG


After the configuration of HAProxy, SSH to all three overcloud controllers. 

Perform the following steps on each controller node:

1. SSH overcloud as root

		ssh heat-admin@<IP address of overcloud>

2. nano  `paas.cfg` to edit the configuration file 

 		/etc/haproxy/manual/paas.cfg

3. Paste the HA Proxy configuration file, which is generated in step 1, at the end of the `pass.cfg` file

4. Save the `pass.cfg` file.

		 CTRL+X

5. Reload HA Proxy

		service haproxy reload 

6. Open the Designate API port in the firewall and run the following commands:

   	a. Run
	
		iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 9001 -j ACCEPT

   	b. Run

		iptables-save > /etc/iptables/iptables 


## Registering the service with Keystone {#keyreg}

You  can register the DNS service and endpoint as a user or an admin. 

You do not have to immediately register the DNS service in Keystone; however, if you choose to register the DNS service and endpoint execute the following command:
 
User:
 
	dnsaas-installer --target-password password keystone-registration

##Initial Service Configuration

You must perform an initial configuration step to communicate the names of the servers that serve DNS to Designate. Please ensure you have a valid set of admin credentials in the standard OS_* environment variables before proceeding.

For the "Nameserver FQDNs" gathered during the [prerequisites](#preq) step, issue a `server-create` command for each name to add the server:
 
	$ designate server-create --name ns1.example.com.

For example :

	designate server-create --name ns1.p13.dynect.net.

##Additional backend install

If you are using Microsoft DNS Server you should perform the following additional steps:

1. Download Designate Microsoft DNS Agent installer.
2. Execute the installer on each of the Microsoft DNS servers.
3. Edit `msdnsagent.conf` files 

		C:\Program Files (x86)\Designate\designate-msdnsagent.conf

4. Restart the `designate-msdnsagent` service using the windows Services GUI. 

##Post-install cleanup

The installer VM is no longer required. Archive the configuration file and the SSH public and private keys used and optionally delete the dnsaas-installer instance.

##Uninstall DNaaS {#uninstall}

To uninstall the DNaaS:

1. Enter the following command to list the DNaaS Stack ID:

	`$ heat stack-list`


2. Using python-heatclient and the Target Credentials supplied to the installer, verify the DNSaaS Stack ID and delete it.

		$ heat stack-delete <stack ID>

**Note**: Installer VM can also be deleted, if it is not deleted already.

The Keystone service and endpoints will not be deleted, if you want to remove these services, please refer to the [Keystone documentation](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/).
