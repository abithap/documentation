  <title>HP Helion 2.0 Development Platform: Continuous Integration and Deployment Overview</title>
  <body>
    <p> "Greenfield" software development provides new functionality for new infrastructure, new
      customers, new owners, or new ideas. </p>
    <p>Writing enterprise apps in such an undefined arena is fundamentally risky, and best practice
      is to take an agile, iteritave approach. </p>
    <p>With Continuous Integration and Deployment (CICD), small project teams can build, test, and
      deploy each functional iteration with little effort, allowing developers to focus on the code,
      not the process.</p>
