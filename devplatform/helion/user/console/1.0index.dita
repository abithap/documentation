<p>The Management Console is a web interface for Application Lifecycle Service (ALS). Using the same API as the ALS command line client, it provides access
to a subset of features for deploying, scaling, and configuring
applications as well as monitoring quota usage, and viewing logs.</p>
<p>The interface differs for Admin and non-Admin users. The features described below are available and visible to
to end users. For information on the Management Console view for Admins, see the ALS Admin Guide.</p>
<section id="welcome"> <title>Welcome</title>
<p>The top-level page of the Management Console displays quick links to the
most commonly used resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Read the Documentation</b>: By default, this links to the ALS documentation at <xref href="../../../../devplatform/helion/1.0index.dita" >docs.hpcloud.com</xref>
</li>
<li>
<b>Contact Support</b>: Link to the <xref type="section" href="#topic6037/user-console-support">

page.</li>
<li>
<b>Download the Client</b>: Link to the locally hosted <xref href="../../../../devplatform/helion/user/client/1.0index.dita#client" type="section"  >
<i>CLI
client</i>
</xref> download.</li>
<li>
<b>Deploy from Sample Applications</b>: Link to the <xref type="section" href="#topic6037/user-console-app-store">Sample Applications</xref>.</li>
<li>
<b>Organizations Membership</b>: Link to the end user view of the
<xref type="section" href="#topic6037/user-console-welcome">
<i>Organizations</i>
</xref> page.</li>
<li>
<b>Account Details</b>: Shows the account details of the current user. Also
accessible from the drop down list at the top left.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="organization-view"> <title>Organization View</title>
<p>The Organizations page shows a list of all
<xref href="../../../../devplatform/helion/user/deploy/1.0orgs-spaces.dita#orgs-spaces" type="section"  >
<i>Organizations</i>
</xref> that the
current user is a member of. Depending on how the ALS PaaS has been
set up, it is possible be a member of only a single Organization.</p>
<p>Clicking on the Organization's name opens a view of that organization,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Quota Usage</b>:

<ul>
<li>Memory: The amount of RAM (in GB) available to the Organization,
and how much of it is currently used by applications.</li>
<li>Services: The number of deployed / allotted services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Domains</b>: Domains belonging to the Organization that can be used by applications deployed to <xref href="../../../../devplatform/helion/user/deploy/1.0orgs-spaces.dita#orgs-spaces" type="section"  >
<i>Spaces</i>
</xref> in the Organization. Typically, these will be a subdomain of the Application Lifecycle Service system itself. For example, an Organization called <codeph>acme</codeph> on a PaaS with the address <codeph>api.example.org</codeph> might have the domain <codeph>\*.acme.example.org</codeph>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Tabs</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Spaces</b>: A list of Spaces that belong to the Organization, showing
the current number of applications and services deployed to that
space. Clicking on a Space in the list opens a <xref type="section" href="#topic6037/user-console-space">
<i>view of that
Space</i>
</xref>.</li>
<li>Users: A list of Users who are members of the Organization, showing
the Email address and Organization
<xref href="../../../../devplatform/helion/user/deploy/1.0orgs-spaces.dita#orgs-spaces-roles" type="section"  >
<i>Roles</i>
</xref> of each.

<ul>
<li>Users: can view organization quotas, domains, spaces and users.</li>
<li>Manager: can add domains and spaces to the organization, but not
users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: There is currently no interface in the Management Console for Managers,
Auditors, or Billing Managers to view or adjust billing/payment info and
spending limits.</p>

<li>
<b>Timeline</b>: A real-time stream of events and discussions relevant to
the Space. The creation, update, and deletion of apps and services

assigned to an application (which makes the item visible in the
Application view).</li>
<li>
<b>Managers</b>: Managers can invite/manage users, enable features for a
given space.</li>
