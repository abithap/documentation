Known Issues:</p>
<ol>

<b>Intermittent Authentication Errors from Keystone</b>. Some requests to keystone will intermittently fail to authenticate. Retrying the request will generally succeed. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Database Service will not install if there are more than three availability zones</b>. You need to have only three availability zones to install the database service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Database Instance and backup deletion not available from the Horizon UI</b>. The Horizon UI is not able to delete database instances and backups. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next release.</p>

<b>Password Field is not used when creating a RabbitMQ cluster</b>. The password field in the Horizon panel is not necessary when creating a RabbitMQ cluster, and will be ignored. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Download PEM not working in the RabbitMQ Panel for the Messaging Service</b>. In Safari browsers the download PEM button results in an error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>RabbitMQ cluster creation fails when a floating IP pool has not been selected</b>. You must select a floating IP pool when creating a RabbitMQ cluster in the messaging service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Using the correct network to connect to an ALS cluster</b>. When pushing applications to ALS, you will be presented with two domains for the new application (unless additional domains have been added by the ALS cluster administrator): a xip.io address such as 10.0.0.1.xip.io, and a local domain such as hphelion-xyz.local. When connecting to the ALS Cluster over a network only the xip.io domain will allow clients to connect to the deployed application, choose this option you they have assigned custom domains to you cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Small DEAs can run out of disk space</b>. The ALS Seed Node Images in 1.0 are shipped in a frozen 10 gigabyte size, resulting in a limited amount of disk space available for applications and services. This can result in highly active clusters failing over time due to a lack of disk space. It is recommended to allocate more 4 gigabyte DEAs rather than fewer larger DEAs.</p>
