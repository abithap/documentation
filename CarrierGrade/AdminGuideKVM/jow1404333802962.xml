                    <p id="11">A host failure occurs when the compute node hardware that
                        hosts the application fails, or when its kernel becomes unresponsive. Host
                        failures are detected by the active controller node through an efficient and
                        scalable monitoring process that runs continuously during normal operation
                        of the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade cluster.</p>
                    <p id="12">When such a failure is detected, the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade

                    <p id="17">From the point of view of a guest application, a hardware failure occurs when the
            hosting virtual machine fails to execute. From the compute node, this means that the
            virtual machine process itself is experiencing execution problems, or that it is no
            longer running.</p>
                    <p id="18">When such a failure is detected, the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade
                        automatically tries to restart the affected virtual machine on the same
                        compute node. If the restart operation fails, the virtual machine is
                        automatically scheduled to deploy on an alternative compute node.</p>
                    <p id="19">Virtual machine monitoring, and its recovery mechanisms, are always available for every

                        unresponsive, the lack of heartbeat messages from the daemon triggers an
                        alarm on the active controller.</p>
                    <p id="24">For all purposes, the virtual machine is considered then to
                        be at fault, and is therefore re-scheduled for execution, first on the same

                                    some resource that is not available, or because of a bug in the
                                    application's logic.</p>

                    <p id="66">Handling of these cases is optional, and subject to the
                        proper API integration into the guest application itself.</p>
                    <p id="67">Application monitoring happens when the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade
                        Heartbeat daemon in the virtual machine registers the application for
                        monitoring. What happens after an application failure occurs is determined
                        when the application is registered. By default, an application failure
                        results in the Nova service triggering a hard reboot of the virtual machine
                        instance.</p>
                    <p id="42">If the application makes use of the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Heartbeat
                        API, it can instruct the active controller on how to proceed when the
                        application declares itself in a state of error. This could include a
                        restart of the virtual machine, which in the case of 1:1 HA application/VM
                        pair, would trigger a VM switchover. The application can also use the <term id="68">VM Peer Notification API</term> to receive notifications
                        when virtual machines in the same server group go up or down.</p>
                    <p id="43">Refer to the <cite id="44">HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade SDK</cite>
                        for more information on how to configure the health-monitoring daemon and
                        the use of the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Heartbeat API.</p>

        <p id="45">Data persistence is another aspect that impacts the high-availability of
            a running application. This is addressed by providing storage persistence across
            applications restarts for Cinder remote HA block storage using distributed storage
            backends, such as 3PAR, for configuration databases.</p>
        <p id="50">By instrumenting the level of interaction between the guest application
            and the health-monitoring system, and by using the appropriate Cinder storage backends,
            guest applications can be deployed to run in different HA scenarios. Note that in all
            cases, monitoring of hardware and virtual machines, and their corresponding failure
            recovery mechanisms, are always active.</p>

            <p id="53">These are applications designed with no consideration for special

                    <p id="55">Stateless applications such as web servers serving static data, and data query systems.
            The requirement in these cases is for the application to be running continuously.</p>
                    <p id="56">This requirement is fulfilled when the application is deployed on the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade
            by the automatic monitoring at the hardware and virtual machine levels. Optionally, the

                        storage persistence across restart operations, that is, for the state to be
                        recoverable when the application restarts.</p>

            <p id="62">Typically, these are legacy applications supporting their own HA framework. They are expected to run unmodified, or with minimal changes, when deployed on the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade.</p>
            <p id="63">As with any other application, HA-aware applications benefit from the
                hardware and virtual machine monitoring processes, which provide them with automatic
                restart upon failures. When coupled with server groups (see <xref href="jow1404333660893.xml" id="64"/>), they also benefit from the
                anti-affinity options to ensure that hot/standby running applications are protected
                against hardware failures.</p>
            <p id="65">HA-aware applications also benefit from internal tenant networks on
