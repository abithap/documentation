            <p id="317">The life cycle of a host is the set of state transitions the host
                goes through as its current state changes. The host states in the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade

                    Specification for Open Systems</cite>.</p>
            <p id="318">The current state of a host is determined by the allowed
                combinations of the administrative, operational, and availability states at any
                given time. The following figure illustrates the life cycle of a host.</p>
