<section id="require"> <title>HP DCN Infrastructure Requirements and Recommendations</title>
<!-- Taken from HP Distributed Cloud Networking 3.0.R2
Installation Guide -->
<p>In order to make use of the HP DCN, the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade environment must meet some key requirements as described in the following sections.</p>
</section>
<section id="ntp-infrastructure"> <title>NTP Infrastructure</title>
<p>Because HP VSP is a distributed system, it is important that the different elements have a reliable reference clock to ensure the messages exchanged between the elements have meaningful timestamps. HP VSP relies on each of the elements having clocks synchronized with
NTP.</p>
<p>The HP VSD and HP VRS applications rely on the NTP facilities provided by the host operating system. The HP VSC, which is based on HP DCN OS, has an NTP client.</p>
<p>HP recommends having at least three NTP reference clocks configured for each system.</p>
</section>
<section id="domain-name-system"> <title>Domain Name System</title>
<p>In scaled HP VSP deployments, the HP VSD functional elements can be distributed across machines into clusters of machines where the failover and load sharing mechanisms for the clusters rely on being referenced as a single DNS entity.</p>
</section>
<section id="certificate-authority"> <title>Certificate Authority</title>
<p>The northbound ReST API on HP VSD is accessed within an SSL session. The HP VSD is able to use a self-signed certificate, but having a certificate from a certificate authority will enable client applications to avoid processing security warnings about unrecognized certificate authorities.</p>

</section>
<section id="hp-vsd-hardware-and-software-requirements"> <title>HP VSD Hardware and Software Requirements</title>
<p>The HP VSD software can run in one or more servers depending on performance and availability requirements. The following table describes the requirements for a single system server configuration. Contact HP for 
guidance on larger scale deployments.</p>

Recommended: processors with higher cores
Note: Hyperthreading must be disabled to achieve the 
best use of the physical cores.

achieve the best performance. </entry>
