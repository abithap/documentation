                        currently supported for an instance using local storage. Locking the host
                        initiates a cold migration. The local storage for the instance is
                        rebuilt.</p>

                        reconfigured instance is instantiated on the same host, then any root or
                        ephemeral disks that use local storage are resized with their data
                        preserved. Swap disks that use local storage are rebuilt. If the instance is
                        migrated to another host, only cold migration is supported. All local
                        storage for the instance is rebuilt.</p>
