    Summary:        Add logs to hbsClient and libalarm-clock
    Description:    Modified log in hbsClient. Expect to see this log on
                    all blade types  'hbsClient patches by
                    PATCH_0001' when hbsClient
                    restarts. Also added a log to ac_init() function
                    that reads "PATCH_0001 patched
                    libalarm-clock".  Should be seen when heartbeat
                    process is restarted on controller and compute.
