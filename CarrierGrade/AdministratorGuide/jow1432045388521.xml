  <p ixia_locid="8">Certain system events that do not result in node state changes and typically do not require
   immediate customer action, such as instance deletions or failed migration attempts, are recorded
   in Customer Logs. Each log describes a single event. The logs are held in a buffer, with older
   logs discarded as needed to release logging space.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="5">The logs are displayed in a list, along with summary information. For each
   individual log, you can view detailed information. For more information, see <xref href="jow1432045421799.xml" ixia_locid="6"/>.</p>
