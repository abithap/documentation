            <p ixia_locid="117">When the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade is deployed, two default tenants are
                created: <nameliteral ixia_locid="118">admin</nameliteral> and <nameliteral ixia_locid="119">services</nameliteral>. They are used to group resources to be
                associated with the user <nameliteral ixia_locid="120">admin</nameliteral> and the
                cloud services, respectively.</p>
            <note id="note_N10211_N101ED_N1001C_N10001" ixia_locid="121">
                <p ixia_locid="122">Earlier versions of OpenStack used the term <term ixia_locid="138">project</term>
                    instead of <term ixia_locid="139">tenant</term>. Because of this legacy terminology, the web
                    administration interface uses both terms, and some command-line tools use
                        <nameliteral ixia_locid="125">--project_id</nameliteral> when a tenant ID is
                    expected.</p>
            </note>
            <p ixia_locid="126">Users are system resources that can operate on one or more tenants, within the constraints
        of a particular role. For each user, the Keystone service maintains a list of (tenant, role)
        tuples, which are used to determine the tenants the user can operate on, and the role the
        user should play on each of them.</p>
            <p ixia_locid="127">In the default installation of the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade, several users are already defined. Each
        of the OpenStack services, such as Nova and Neutron, exist as system users. They all operate
        on the default tenant <nameliteral ixia_locid="128">services</nameliteral>.</p>
            <p ixia_locid="129">The Keystone <nameliteral ixia_locid="130">admin</nameliteral> user
                is associated with the <nameliteral ixia_locid="131">admin</nameliteral> tenant.
                This user has administrator privileges for creating, modifying, and deleting
                OpenStack resources, including creating other tenants and users.</p>
