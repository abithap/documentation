  <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade supports programming access using REST APIs. By default, access using the HTTP
   protocol is supported. For increased security, you can enable  HTTPS access during system
   installation.</p>
  <p>To enable HTTPS access, you must obtain a digital certificate and copy it to the first
   controller before starting the controller configuration script. For more information, see <xref
