<p>Each network can be assigned a router, which provides a gateway to external networks.</p>
<p>You can use the dashboards to create, delete, and configure your HP Helion OpenStack network and subnet(s). You can also manage the ports in your network.</p>
<p>How you interact with your network environment depends upon your user type, either an administrative user (admin) or a non-administrative user (user).</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The admin can perform all of the user tasks in addition to the admin tasks.</p>
<section id="managing-your-router-as-a-user"> <title>Managing your router as a user</title>
<p>As a user, you can work with the router in the active project.</p>
<p>Access the router commands using the Networks panel on the Project dashboard.</p>
<p>The Network panel contains commands to view a visual representation of your network and to enable you to work with your router.</p>

<p>As an admin user, you can work on all of the network(s) in your domain, regardless of which project the network is associated with.</p>
<p>An admin can create a shared network, which can be seen in every project in the domain. You can also create an external network.</p>
