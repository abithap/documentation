    <p>For installation and maintenance, HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade consists of two logical
      or conceptual <i>regions</i>: Non-KVM and KVM. The Non-KVM region contains the HP Helion
      Lifecycle Management (HLM), to deploy and maintain HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade; and HP
      Helion OpenStack, a commercial-grade distribution of OpenStack.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> These regions do not function as OpenStack regions. </p>

<section><title>HP Helion Lifecycle Management</title>
  <p>The Non-KVM environment includes a full installation of HP Helion Lifecycle Management (HLM).
    HLM is an application that is used to deploy HP Helion OpenStack Carrier
    Grade and can be used for ongoing operations and maintenance of the system.</p>
  <ul id="ul_bhj_clv_ls">
    <li>
      <p>
            <b>Physical Node Preparation.</b> HLM can configure nodes prior to installation of a
            base operating system, including node discovery/inventory, BIOS configuration,
            (specifically setting PXE boot on primary interface), GRUB settings, RAID setup for
            local disks, iLO/IPMI set up and firmware upgrades.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
            <b>OS Install.</b> HLM can take a PXE bootable node and installs a base operating
            system.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
            <b>Cloud Configuration.</b> HLM can provide detailed information about the cloud
            topology, such as the structure of control plane, assignment of services to nodes, and
            service configuration. You can also specify environment-specific configurations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>OS Configuration.</b> HLM can automatically execute operating system configuration
        values, such as NIC assignments, NTP settings, DNS settings, NIC bonding, sysctl settings,
        VLAN creation etc. HLM uses the Ansible data model output and HLM server playbooks to
        automatically apply the per-node configurations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
            <b>Helion Operation &amp; Maintenance.</b> HLM is responsible for the deploy, upgrade
            and maintenance lifecycle of the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade system.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
