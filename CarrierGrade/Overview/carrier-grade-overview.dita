      <p><b>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade (HCG)</b> is a carrier grade OpenStack plus compute
        and network virtualization offering for NFV that enable CSPs to deploy network functions
        virtualization (NFV) applications on open source software platforms. </p>
      <p>Some key examples include the host operating system (for example, Linux), server
        virtualization (KVM), network virtualization (vSwitch and SDN controllers), an installer and
        cloud lifecycle management framework, fault and performance management, and
        high-availability framework for the OpenStack control plane and the NFVI layer.</p>
      <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade is based on <xref
          href="../../commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.index.dita">HP Helion Openstack 1.1</xref> but
        with significantly enhanced and optimized functionality, availability, scale and performance
        to meet the needs of NFV cloud deployments.</p>
      <p>Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade includes following key components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>OpenStack—core services including Horizon, Nova, Neutron, Cinder, Glance, Swift,
          Keystone, Ceilometer, and Heat. Other services will be added as needed in the future.</li>
        <li>Compute node software package that includes: <ul>
            <li>Carrier-grade Linux (host operating system [OS] running on the compute nodes)</li>
            <li>Carrier-grade KVM (for virtualization of the compute node)</li>
            <li>Carrier-grade accelerated virtual switch (AVS), data plane development kit
              (DPDK)-enabled high-performance virtual switch</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>Management and middleware—composed of high-availability (HA) management; operations,
          administration, and maintenance (OAM); software image management; and fault and
          performance management</li>
        <li>Guest software development kit (SDK) for inclusion in the guest OS of the VNF for
          performance acceleration and improving the HA framework above and beyond standard
          VIMs</li>
        <li>HP Helion Lifecycle Manager (HLM)—cloud installer and lifecycle manager</li>
      </ul>

      <title>Major Components in HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade</title>
      <p>For installation and maintenance, HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade consists of two logical
        or conceptual <i>regions</i>: Non-KVM and KVM. See the <xref
          href="../Installation/carrier-grade-technical-overview.dita#topic3485/deploy-arch"
          >Deployment Architecture diagram</xref> in the Technical Overview for an illustration of
        these two zones. </p>
      <p><b>Non-KVM</b></p>
      <p>The Non-KVM region contains the HP Helion Lifecycle Management (HLM), to deploy and
        maintain HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade; and HP Helion OpenStack, a commercial-grade
        distribution of OpenStack. The Non-KVM region consists of a host system for HLM and three HP
        Helion OpenStack controllers.</p>
      <p>For more information, see <xref href="carrier-grade-overview-non-kvm.dita">Non-KVM
          Environment Overview</xref>.</p>
      <p><b>KVM</b></p>
      <p>The KVM region is the heart of HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade. The KVM region consists
        of a software platform, providing ultra-reliability and exceptional performance efficiencies
        for telecommunications networks. </p>
