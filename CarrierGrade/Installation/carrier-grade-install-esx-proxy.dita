  <p>The HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade vCenter ESX compute proxy (compute proxy) is a driver that enables the Compute service to communicate with 
    a VMware vCenter server managing one or more ESX hosts. The HP Helion OpenStack Compute Service (Nova) requires 
    this driver to interface with VMware ESX hypervisor APIs.</p>
  
  <p>After installing and configuring the VMware ESX and vCenter Server, use the following instructions to install the compute proxy. 
    The compute proxy is distributed as open virtual appliance (OVA).</p>
  
  <p>The ESX and vCenter server should be installed within the non-KVM region and attached to the
      CLM network, as shown in the <xref href="carrier-grade-technical-overview.dita#topic3485">Technical Overview</xref></p>

    <p>The HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade installation process includes an open virtual appliance (OVA) file that you import into 
      vCenter. Compute proxy template needs to be available in the vCenter before the deploying the HP Helion OpenStack cloud
       (before you run hprovision script).</p>
    
    <p>Compute proxy is deployed in vCenter using File > Deploy OVF Template > [Path to TEMPL-CPV5.ova on 15.242.209.7]</p>
    
    <p>It is not required by the cloud deployment for the proxy template to be powered on  </p>
