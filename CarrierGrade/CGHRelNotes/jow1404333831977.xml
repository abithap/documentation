            <title>Cinder Block Storage snapshot feature not working </title>
            <p>For HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade cloud using 3PAR iSCSI configured as the Cinder
                block storage service. The Cinder volume snapshot feature might not function
                properly if following entries are enabled in the
                    <codeph>/etc/cinder/cinder.conf</codeph> file. </p>
            <codeblock>#hp3par_snapshot_retention=48
#hp3par_snapshot_expiration=72</codeblock>
            <p> To correct this issue, edit the <codeph>/etc/cinder/cinder.conf</codeph> file to
                disable these entries, as follows:</p>
            <codeblock>#hp3par_snapshot_retention=48
#hp3par_snapshot_expiration=72           </codeblock>
            <p>The <codeph>hp3par_snapshot_retention</codeph> entry is the time in hours to retain a
                snapshot.</p>
            <p>The <codeph>hp3par_snapshot_expiration</codeph> entry is the time in hours when a
                snapshot expires and is deleted. </p>

            <title>LDAP conflict causing error with templates</title>
            <p>When deploying templates, such as <codeph>VMAutoScaling.yaml</codeph> you might
                receive a n error similar to the following: <codeph>Error: Canâ€™t find role
                    heat_stack_user</codeph>.</p>
            <p>The problem is due to an inconsistency in the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade LDAP
                implementation. To fix this problem, you should disable LDAP in Keystone. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Before deploying HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade, edit the definition.json as
                    the following flag is set to 0. <codeblock>"ldap_enabled": 1,</codeblock></li>
                <li>After deploying HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade, on each controller, modify
                    the <codeph>/etc/keystone/keystone.conf</codeph> to comment-out the LDAP entry
                    and uncomment SQL driver, as shown:
                    <codeblock>[identity]
driver = keystone.identity.backends.sql.Identity
#driver = keystone.identity.backends.ldap.Identity</codeblock></li>
