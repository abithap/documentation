    <section><title>Basic Configuration</title>
      <p>There are several mandatory requirements to execute a backup: <ul>
          <li>Action (backup by default)</li>
          <li>Mode (fs by default)</li>
          <li>Path-to-backup</li>
          <li>Backup-name</li>
          <li>Container (swift container or local path)</li>
          <li>Storage (swift by default)</li>
        </ul></p> For HP Helion OpenStackÂ® 2.0 Beta 1, a backup using only mandatory values would be
      as follows:
      <codeblock>  - freezerc --action backup --mode fs --storage swift --path-to-backup /home/user/tmp --container tmp_backups --backup-name backup1</codeblock>
      The translation to a configuration file for this backup execution would be as follows:
      <codeblock>

  {
    "job_actions": [
        {
            "freezer_action": {
                "action": "backup",
                "mode": "fs",
                "backup_name": "backup1",
                "path_to_backup": "/home/user/tmp",
                "container": "tmp_backups"
            },
            "max_retries": 3,
            "max_retries_interval": 60
        }
    ],
    "job_schedule": {
        "schedule_interval": "24 hours"
    },
    "description": "backup for tmp dir"
  }
</codeblock>
      In this configuration file (JSON), the freezer command is wrapped in a "freezer_action".
        <note>All "-" are translated to "_" and the first "--" are omitted.</note> HP Helion
      OpenStack 2.0 Beta 1, we can define the schedule rules that this job will follow (only
      available through the configuration file) and a brief description of the job. </section>
