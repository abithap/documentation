  <title>HP Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> 2.0: Installing via the GUI </title>
  <body><!--Needs Edit-->
    <section> HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 comes with a UI, the Dayzero Installer, for first-time installation of your
      cloud. Rather than editing a number of YAML files to input your specific
      configuration data, the UI presents forms in which you may enter this information. This can simplify the process of 
      manually finding specific fields and can help avoid syntax errors in the YAML files.</section>
    <section>In addition, rather than having to run a series of commands to execute the Cobbler and
      Ansible scripts that initiate the installation of HP Helion OpenStack, the UI application automates much of the installation process. </section>
    <section>You can use the UI to inspect the configuration data at any time. Any edits made via the UI are written to the configuration files when 
      you click the Deploy button. If you simultaneously edit the configuration files manually outside the UI, any changes you have made will be overwritten 
      when you click the Deploy button in the GUI.</section>


    <section>The YAML configuration files are stored in a local git repository, as
      explained in <xref href="installation/using_git.dita">Using git for Configuration
        Management</xref>. <p>When installing via the GUI, you are starting with a model (example
        cloud configuration) and can and must edit the underlying example to reflect your
        environment.</p> However, the full range of customizations is not possible via the GUI as
      some configuration items are not exposed. Below is the list of what can and cannot be changed: </section>
    <section><b>Changes to the following items may be made:</b><ul id="ul_hsd_bym_tt">
        <li>servers (including Linux for HP Helion  installation configuration) </li>
        <li>networks </li>
        <li>disk models </li>
        <li>interface models </li>
        <li>NIC mappings </li>
        <li>NTP servers (cloudConfig.yml) </li>
        <li>tags in network groups</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Changes to the following items cannot be made: </b><ul id="ul_b5d_bym_tt">

      </ul>
    </section>
    <section><title>Before you begin</title> Before you run the GUI installer to install your cloud,
      there are a number of things you need to do to prepare. <ol>
        <li>Prepare your servers</li>
        <li>Gather your information <ul>
            <li>Server names </li>
            <li>IP addresses </li>
            <li>Server Roles </li>
            <li>PXE MAC addresses </li>
            <li>PXE IP addresses </li>
            <li>PXE interfaces </li>
            <li>IPMI/iLO IP address, username, password </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Choose your <xref href="example_configurations.dita">cloud model/example</xref> template. Note
          that the only option for the Cloud model on KVM with VSA is to have 0 or 3 VSA nodes;
          there is no option to have 0 VSA nodes. Note also that you cannot put the
          deployer/lifecycle manager on a dedicated node using the GUI installer; it can only run in
          the control plane using the models exposed here.</li>
        <li>Before you use the GUI to install your cloud, you may install the operating system, HP
          Linux for HP Helion OpenStack, on your nodes (servers) based on your hypervisor, if you
          prefer. Otherwise the installer will install it for you. The option is available in the
          GUI. <!--  TODO this doesn't make sense -->If you deci You must do so by following the appropriate installation instructions. <ul>
            <!-- TDOD Fix link for KVM -->
            <li><xref href="gui_install_on_kvm.dita">KVM</xref></li>
            <li><xref href="installation/install_entryscale_esx.dita#install_esx/prereqs"
                >ESX</xref></li>
          </ul> For ESX installations, modify  <codeph>~/helion/hos/ansible/hlm-deploy.yml</codeph> to uncomment
          the line containing eon-deploy.yml. You must then comment out the line containing
          ceph-deploy.yml, vsa-deploy.yml, and cmc-deploy.yml. Then if you need to, follow the
          instructions in <xref
            href="installation/install_entryscale_esx.dita#install_esx/optional-eon">Step 4
            here</xref><p id="chooseHypervisor"/><note>Before starting the GUI, you will also need
            to remove executable permission on <codeph>~/hlm-ux-implementation/server/ansible/hosts/localhost</codeph>.
            Execute the following command to do so:
            <codeblock>chmod -x ~/hlm-ux-implementation/server/ansible/hosts/localhost </codeblock>This
            will set the correct permission on the localhost file so that the <codeph>ready-install-os.yml</codeph>
            playbook can run and install the operating system on the nodes.</note>
        </li>

      </ol>

    <section><title>Running the GUI to install your cloud</title>
      <p>Now that the operating system, HP Linux for HP Helion OpenStack, is installed on all your servers
        (nodes), you will configure and install your cloud using the GUI.</p>
      <p>The GUI is found on the deployer node at: <b>http://&lt;Deployer_IP>:79/dayzero</b></p>
      <p>To create a secure tunnel/port forwarding into Apache from the deployer to enable use of
        the GUI in a browser, SSH tunnel into the deployer with the username/password set up when
        installing the deployer. Username and password should be what was set in "Set up the
        Deployer" in the installation instructions. For example:</p>
      <codeblock>ssh -v -N -L 8080:&lt;Deployer_IP>:79 &lt;Username>@&lt;Deployer_IP></codeblock>
      <p>Then on your local machine, point your web browser to: http://localhost:8080/dayzero</p> As
      you proceed through the GUI, you need only supply your server names and IP addresses. </section>
    <section>In the Assign network groups: External VM network fields, <b>do not</b> add entries for
      CIDR, Gateway, or IP Range, only VLAN ID. Neutron will assign these.<p>When the installation
        is complete, the Ansible log will be displayed on the final page.</p>
    </section>
    <section><title>Using the installer securely</title>
      <p> The GUI installer is a web-based application that runs on the deployer/lifecycle manager
        node and is implemented in nodejs. Currently this application runs behind Apache 2.0 where
        requests are proxied to the nodejs Express Web Server. The nodejs Express Server runs on
        port 3000 and Apache runs on port 79. </p>
      <p>You should access the installer through Apache and not directly from the Express server. An
        Example URL looks like this: <codeph>http://&lt;deployer-host-ip>:79/dayzero</codeph>. When you finish
        installing, the Installer will be disabled via Ansible. The GUI installer will also be disabled 
        if you complete a deployment using the CLI. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>The GUI is used only once: during the initial installation of your cloud.</p><p>For VSA you
        must follow the steps outlined in the <xref href="installation/configure_vsa.dita">VSA
          Configuration</xref> page.</p> After deployment, continue to <xref
        href="installation/installation_verification.dita">Verifying Your Installation</xref> and <xref
        href="installation/postinstall_checklist.dita">Post-Installation
        Checklist</xref>.<p>To understand a cloud configuration more thoroughly and to learn how to
        make any changes later, visit these documentation pages: <ul id="ul_akt_fv2_lt">

          <li><xref href="installation/using_git.dita">Using Git for Configuration Management</xref></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <note>The GUI installer is disabled after deployment finishes - either via the GUI or
        via the command line. If you want to re-enable the GUI later but are not re-installing from
        scratch, run these commands:
        <codeblock>sudo a2ensite dayzero-apache.conf
sudo systemctl start dayzero.service</codeblock>
