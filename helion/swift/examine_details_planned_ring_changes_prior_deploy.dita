      <note>You must run the <codeph>_swift-validate-input-model.yml</codeph> playbook as mentioned
        in step <b>1</b> in <b> </b><xref

        otherwise the files needed to run the <codeph>swiftlm-ring-supervisor</codeph> will not be
        in place on the node. </note>

              <li>Drives are being added to all rings in the ring specifications.</li>
              <li>Servers are being used as expected (for example, you may have a different set of

              <li>The weight value is as expected. The weight value is the drive size expressed in
