It provides an example for the configuration of the mid sized cloud. You must use this example model as the basis for building a cloud model for your actual cloud by configuring the server and network that you plan to deploy. To deploy Swift using this model you must make Swift -specific changes to the provided example.--></p>

        <p> The Swift-proxy service uses two other cloud services. Both of these are configured in

        <ul>
          <li>Swift validates tokens by making requests to the Keystone service</li>
          <li>Swift caches tokens and other data using the memcached service</li>
