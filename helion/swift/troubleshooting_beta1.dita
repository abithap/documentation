    <section><b>Interpreting _swift-validate-input-model.yml Errors</b></section>
    <p>When you execute the <codeph>_swift-validate-input-model.yml</codeph> playbook it can be hard
      to pick out the errors being reported. If so, you view the error messages as follows:<ol
        id="ol_szd_tht_dt">
        <li>Log onto the first node in the system that is running the swift-proxy-server process.
            <note> You must run the <codeph>_swift-validate-input-model.yml</codeph> playbook as
            mentioned in step <b>2</b> in <xref
              href="../installation.dita#topic_flx_j2b_ws/CloudDeploy"/> otherwise the files needed
            to run the <codeph>swiftlm-ring-supervisor</codeph> will not be in place on the node.
          </note></li>
        <li>Execute the following
            command:<codeblock>sudo swiftlm-ring-supervisor --make-delta --report </codeblock><p>
            The command will report any errors or problems (see List of errors) with the input
            model. It also prints a summary of the ring create actions that are planned (i.e., that
            will occur) for the deploy phase of the process.</p></li>
      </ol></p>
    <section><b>List of errors</b></section>
    <p>You can see the list of errors and the resolution as follows:</p>
    <p>
      <note>To resolve an error by changing the input, you <b>must</b> re-run the configuration
        processor as describe in <xref
          href="../installation.dita#topic_flx_j2b_ws/run-config-processor">Run the Configuration
          Processor</xref> and continue with the deploy.</note>

        <li><b>Example Message</b>:<b> Model Missmatch: Cannot find drive /dev/sdt on
            padawan-ccp-c1-m2 (192.168.245.3)</b>
          <p><b>Description</b></p><p>The disk model used for node padawan-ccp-c1-m2 has drive
              <codeph>/dev/sdt</codeph> listed in the devices list of a device-group where Swift is
            the consumer. However, the <codeph>dev/sdt</codeph>  device does not exist on that
            node.</p><p><b>Resolution</b></p><p>If a drive or controller is failed on a node, the
            drive may not be seen by the operating system and hence the corresponding block device
            might not exist. Sometimes this is transitory and a reboot may resolve the problem. The
            problem might not be with <codeph>/dev/sdt</codeph>, but with another drive. For
            example, if <codeph>/dev/sds</codeph> is failed, when you boot the node, the drive that
            you expect to be called <codeph>/dev/sdt</codeph> is actually called
              <codeph>/dev/sds</codeph> . Alternatively, you may simply not have enough drives
            installed in the server. You can add drives. Another option is to remove <codeph>
              /dev/sdt</codeph> from the appropriate disk model. However, this removes the drive for
            all servers using the disk model .</p></li>
