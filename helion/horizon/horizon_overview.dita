    <p>Horizon is the OpenStack service that serves as the basis for the HP Helion OpenStack
      dashboards.</p>
    <p>The dashboards provide a web-based user interface to HP Helion OpenStack services including
      Compute, Volume Operations, Networking, and Identity.</p>
    <section>
      <p/>
      <p>The left side of the UI displays Project, Admin, and Settings sectins. They expand and
        contract to show available tasks grouped into <b>panels</b>.</p>
      <p>Across the top are menus to switch between projects and menus where you can access user
        settings.</p>

    <section>
      <p>At the bottom of this page, you can see some of the services you can manage right from the
        dashboard.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="DashProject">
      <title>Project dashboard</title>
      <p>Use the <b>Project</b> dashboard to implement and build out your cloud. This dashboard
        contains tools to create virtual server instances, create and configure your network,
        configure access tools (such as key pairs and security groups) and cloud resource templates
        (stacks).</p>
    </section>
    <section id="DashAdmin">
      <title>Admin dashboard</title>
      <p>Use the <b>Admin</b> dashboard to view, allocate, and manage all resources within the
        cloud.</p>
      <p>The Admin dashboard allows you to manage instances, define flavors, create and configure
        images, manage networks, view system resources, manage projects, and manage users.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="DashSettings">
      <title>Settings dashboard</title>
      <p>Use the <b>Settings</b> dashboard to change your display language and settings, your time
        zone, and your password.</p>
      <p>Click <b>Settings</b> in the user menu to display the Settings dashboard.</p>

      <li><p>The UserID with the "admin" role is provided with a special tab called Admin. The menu options
            underneath this tab are similar to the non-admin user views but cover all projects as
            well as some additional panels not available to general users. </p>
        <p>The Overview page provides a summary by project of the current 
        utilization of major OpenStack resources.  The information on this 
        screen is drawn directly from the Compute or Nova service API and provides 
        the ability to filter the query by date range and an option to download results 
        into a CSV file that is compatible with Microsoft Excel or can be imported 
        into a database.</p>
      </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you are a non-admin user, you will only be able to select a Project from the list at
            the top of the screen.</p></li>

        following screen shots illustrate some of the services you can manage in the Horizon
        dashboard. There is both an overcloud Horizon dashboard and an undercloud dashboard, both of
        which are accessible via your URL in a browser.
        <!--Removed anchor point images--><!-- id="images" --></p>
      <note>In Beta 2 you will not be able to launch an instance from a volume in Horizon. To work around this issue you have two options:
        <ul><li>
        From Horizon Dashboard | Instances page: Launch an Instance and select source as Bootable volume.
        </li><li>Use the OpenStack or Nova client to create the instance.</li></ul></note>

        <ul>
          <li>The <b>Updates and Extensions </b>panel provides a list of available files that can be
          downloaded and installed. This view is also only available to UserIDs with the admin role. </li>
           <li>
          <b>Host aggregates </b>are a grouping of physical servers or hosts with associated
          metadata. A host can belong to multiple aggregates. </li>
        <li>Common use cases for host aggregates include supporting the scheduling of instances to a
          subset of hosts that have a specific capability or flavor such as a specific type of
          storage, lots of RAM, and/or large numbers of processors. <p/>Another use case of host
          aggregates is to support the arrangement of hosts into logical groups for load balancing
          and instance distribution. Host aggregates are configured and only viewable by system
          admins. The end user view of a host aggregate is called an Availability Zone. Availability
          zones are created via the Nova API and the host aggregates function. End users can use
          availability zones for similar use cases. For example, an application could be deployed on
          hosts in multiple availability zones. A load balancer can then be configured and the
          instances running each deployment of the application in each availability zone can be
          assigned to the load balancer thus providing a measure of failover and high availability
          support.<p/> Additional information on host aggregates and availability zones is available
          at <xref

        <li>
          <b>The Instances panel </b>provides a view of all deployed enduser instances across all
            projects, the images applied to those instances, the status of each instance, flavor
            type, and network information. This information is also supplied by the Nova API.
          </li>
          <li><b>The Volumes panel</b> is displayed if the OpenStack Cinder service is available.
            Cinder provides block storage infrastructure. Block storage provides the ability for end
            users to attach storage as discrete drives to a compute instance. These drives are
            persistent and can be reassigned to a different instance. The Volumes tab on this view
            shows all currently created volumes and associated metadata and status, which physical
            host the volume is hosted on, and the ability for the admin to manage each volume.
          </li><li>
          <b>Flavors </b>are virtual hardware templates. Flavors are used to define a virtual
          compute host. Flavors are assigned during the creation of a new instance. This panel
          displays all of the current flavor types and provides the ability for the admin to create,
          edit or delete flavors. Hosting organizations often use flavors as a form of billing unit;
          flavors with more resources are charged at a higher rate than flavors with fewer
            resources.<p>Flavors are virtual hardware templates. Flavors are used to define a

          <li><b>Images</b> are discrete software builds that can be loaded onto an instance. An
          image can be a standalone operating system implementation or a bundle of operating system
          and other pre-configured applications. This panel displays all currently available images
          and associated metadata and enables the system administrator to create, edit and delete
          images. </li>
          <li><b>Networks</b> are used by end users to provide connectivity to and between their
          deployed instances. This panel provides a list of all currently deployed networks and
          associated metadata and enables the system administrator the ability to created, edit, and
          delete networks. </li>
       
          <li><b>Quotas </b>provide the means to limit resource usage. Quotas are assigned per
          project. This panel provides a view of all current quotas and enables a system
          administrator with the ability to edit quota line items. </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Identity panel</b> has two major panels. The Projects panel provides a list of all
          current projects and enables a system administrator the ability to create, modify, and
          delete panels and panel membership. </li><li>
          <b>The Users panel </b>is available only to system administrators and provides the ability
          to create, modify, and delete users. These users are considered "local" to Keystone and
          are authenticated by Keystone. </li>
