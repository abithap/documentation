  <title>Adding, Removing, and Repairing Nodes</title>
  <body>
    <p> If you are planning to scale up, have a failed server, or need to remove a node, there are a
      few things to remember. For control plane nodes, right now you need to maintain three.
      Therefore you will not remove a control plane node completely; you will just replace it. If you
      are swapping out the hardware for that control plane node, and the same is true for compute
      nodes, the process is to keep the entry you have in the <b>servers.yml</b> and
        <b>baremetalConfig.yml</b> files but change hardware-specific iinformation, such the MAC
      addresses, IMPI username, IPMI IP address (if changed) and IPMI pasword.</p>
     <p> To add compute nodes, which can total up to 100 at this point, the process is to add
      entries to the <b>servers.yml</b> and <b>baremetalConfig.yml</b> files.</p>
    <p>To remove compute nodes, you will remove their entries in <b>servers.yml</b> after you
      disable provisioning, migrate any running instances, and stop the Nova compute service.</p>
