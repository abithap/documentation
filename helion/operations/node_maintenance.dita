  <title>Adding, Removing, and Repairing Nodes</title>
  <body>
    <p> If you are planning to scale up, have a failed server, or need to remove a node, there are a
      few things to remember. For control plane nodes, right now you need to maintain three.
      Therefore you will not remove a control plane node comletely; you will just replace it. If you
      are swapping out the hardware for that control plane node, and the same is true for compute
      nodes, the process is to keep the entry you have in <b>servers.yml</b> and
        <b>baremetalConfig.yml</b> files but change harware-specific iinformation, such the MAC
      addresses, IMPI username, IPMI IP address (if changed) ad IPMI pasword.</p>
     <p> To add compute nodes, which can total up to 99 at this point, the process is to add entries
      to the <b>servers.yml</b> and <b>baremetalConfig.yml</b> files.</p>
    <p>To remove compute nodes, you will remove their entries in <b>servers.yml</b> after you disabe
      provisioning, migrate any running instances, and stop the Nova compute service</p>
    <p>Instructions for storage node scale out, repair, and removal are found in the respective
      storage sections:</p>
