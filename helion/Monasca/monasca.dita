    <p>Monasca is a multi-tenant, scalable, fault-tolerant monitoring-as-a-service, HTTP-based
      service. It is open-source and integrates with OpenStack. It uses a REST API for high-speed
      metrics processing and querying, and has a streaming alarm and notification engine. The name
      "Monasca" is short for "monitoring at scale".</p>
    <p>In the Helion OpenStack 2.0 release, the OpenStack monitoring standard, Monasca, is supported
      as the Helion OpenStack monitoring solution with the following exceptions (which are not
      implemented):</p>
    <ul id="ul_scl_svw_ps">
      <li>Transform Engine</li>
      <li>Events Engine </li>
      <li>Anomaly and Prediction Engine</li>
    </ul>
    <note>Icinga, which was the supported monitor service in previous releases of Helion OpenStack,
      is not supported in Helion OpenStack 2.0.</note>

      <p>The Ops Console (Operations Console) is designed for Helion OpenStack Administrators to
        have a web-based UI that they can use to view data about their Helion OpenStack
        infrastructure. The Ops Console is a web-based GUI that offers the user access to data such
        as a alarms data by service, performance data, compute nodes and instances lists, and a
        drilldown to Kibana for a deep look into logs. The Business Logic Layer is a middleware
        component that serves as a single point of contact for the UI to communicate with OpenStack
        services such as Monasca, Nova, and others.</p>
