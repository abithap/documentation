      <title>Migrating the Cinder Volume and Backup Services</title>
      <p>Due to the single threading required in both cinder volume and the drivers and because of
        cinder backups dependency on cinder volume, the cinder volume and backup services are
        started on one controller node only at a time. By default cinder volume and cinder backup
        are started on the first node in the cinder volume and backup hostgroup. If needed the
        volume and backup services can be migrated to a different node in the hostgroup. The
        following steps explain how to migrate the services to a specified host.<ol
          id="ol_mmx_mkb_kt">
          <li>Get the hostname of the node cinder volume and backup are to be migrated to. <p>For
              example: <codeblock>$ hostname
padawan-ccp-c1-m2-mgmt</codeblock></p></li>
          <li>Run the <codeph>cinder-migrate-volume.yml</codeph> playbook specifying the node to
            migrate to in the "migrate_host"
            argument.<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible 
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts cinder-migrate-volume.yml --extra-vars "migrate_host=padawan-ccp-c1-m2-mgmt"</codeblock>After
            successful running of <codeph>cinder-migrate-volume.yml</codeph> playbook, the cinder
            volume and backup services should be running on the specified node. For example:
              <codeph>padawan-ccp-c1-m2-mgmt</codeph>. <p>If the original node where the services
              were running is restarted, the cinder volume and backup services will not restart on
              this node. For example: it will not start on <codeph> padawan-ccp-c1-m1-mgmt</codeph>.
              To get the cinder volume and backup services running again on
                <codeph>padawan-ccp-c1-m1-mgmt</codeph>, run the
                <codeph>cinder-migrate-volume.yml</codeph> playbook again by setting the
              "migrate_host" value to <codeph>padawan-ccp-c1-m1-mgmt</codeph>.</p></li>
