    Standalone Independent Node</title>
  <body>
    <p/>
    <p>HOS 2.0 recommends 3 monitor deployment for production setup. As monitor is more of CPU and
      RAM sensitive only and does not any storage, we do recommend deployment of monitor on
      controller node itself instead of deploying it on standalone nodes. It will help in effective
      utilization of nodes. However if customer wants, he can choose to deploy monitor on
      independent node instead on controller node. </p>
    <p>Reasons can be one of the below or something else:<ol id="ol_rwy_syx_qt">
        <li>Need to have more than 3 monitor nodes or,</li>
        <li>Do not want to mix services running on controller nodes with monitor service of ceph
            <p>Customer can achieve so by modifying cloud input model and treating monitor nodes as
            resource nodes. Please node that we do not support deployment transition i.e. customer
            can not deploy monitor on controller node day-1 and later migrate to standalone node. He
            or she needs to decide upfront before deploying ceph. </p></li>
