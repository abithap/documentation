      <p><b>New GUI Installer</b></p>
      <p>HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 Beta 2 introduces a GUI installer for configuring and installing
        OpenStack and OpenStack services. It provides an easy way to populate the configuration
        files needed to define the <xref href="input_model.dita">Input Model</xref>, and uses them
        to configure and install your cloud. For help using the installer, see the page <xref
          href="gui_installer.dita#install_gui"/>.</p><p>Note that in Beta 2, the GUI does not have
        final help text and has placeholder text on screens.</p>
      <p><b>Transport Layer Security (TLS) Support</b>
      </p>
      <p>TLS is now supported for public endpoints. See <xref
          href="security/tls.dita#topic_yym_nps_4t">Enabling TLS for Public Endpoints</xref> for
        more information.</p>
      <p><b>Encryption of sensitive data</b></p>
      <p>In this release, connection details and passwords are encrypted and or protected. See <xref
          href="security/encrypted_storage.dita">Encryption of Passwords and
          Sensitive Data </xref>for more information.</p>
      <p><b>AppArmor enabled</b></p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p><b>Dedicated Deployer Node No Longer Required</b></p>
      <p>You can now use either a dedicated deployer node or setup the deployer on your first
        controller node. If you choose to use your first controller node as your deployer, ensure
        that your <codeph>servers.yml</codeph> file contains the <codeph>is-deployer: true</codeph>
        notation in the options. If you are using a dedicated deployer node you can omit this. Here
        is an example snippet of a <codeph>servers.yml</codeph> file where a user is using their
        first controller node as their deployer:
        <codeblock># Controllers
- id: controller1
  ip-addr: 192.168.10.3
  role: CONTROLLER-ROLE
  server-group: RACK1
  nic-mapping: HP-DL360-4PORT
  mac-addr: b2:72:8d:ac:7c:6f
  ilo-ip: 192.168.9.3
  ilo-password: password
  ilo-user: admin
  <b>is-deployer: true</b></codeblock></p>
      <p><b>The Installer only supports English language</b></p>
      <p>The deployer installation process prompts you to select a language, however only the
        English language as been tested. Therefore, at this time that is the only supported
        language.</p>
      <p><b>Local Git repository for config tracking</b></p>
      <p>In HP Helion OpenStack 2.0, a local git repository is used to track configuration changes
        and for the config processor to gather configuration settings from. The operations work as
        explained below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operations under <codeph>~/helion</codeph> are under the aegis of git. You’ll need to
          commit any config into git (on the "site" branch) before the Configuration Processor can
          run it. The script that runs the config processor now guards against uncommitted
          changes.</li>
        <li>Deployment operations are run from a scratch directory that's assembled from various
          parts (the ansible output of the Configuration Processor and the playbooks). The directory
          is created using <codeph>ready-deployment.yml</codeph>.</li>
        <li>All deployment operations should be run from
            <codeph>~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible</codeph>.</li>
      </ul>The Configuration Processor uses the config files stored in the repo to apply
      configuration settings. An explanation can be found <xref
        href="installation/using_git.dita">in this topic</xref>. <p><b>New UEFI support</b></p>
      <p>Beta 2 introduces support for UEFI (which replaces the BIOS on newer servers), while
        continuing to support Legacy BIOS. Select the required mode on each node through its BIOS
        settings before beginning the install process. The installer will detect and use the mode
        you have selected for each node.</p>
      <p><b>Updated HP Helion OpenStack Services</b></p>
      <p>We have included the core set of OpenStack services from the <xref
          href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ReleaseNotes/Kilo" scope="external" format="html"
          >Kilo release</xref> with the exception of limitations notated in this document.</p>
      <p><b>More Cinder Backend Options Available</b></p>
      <p>You can now choose between Ceph, VSA, and 3PAR for Cinder backends.</p>
      <p>See: <xref href="blockstorage/blockstorage_overview.dita">Cinder Overview</xref> for more
        details</p>
      <p><b>Neutron LBaaS and FWaaS Extensions</b></p>
      <p>We have implemented networking extensions for load balancing and firewalls. Here is a
        description of each of these:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>LBaaS (Load-Balancing-as-a-Service) is a Neutron extension that introduces a load
            balancing feature set. HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 includes the V2 version which allows
            implementation uses haproxy but third-party Load Balancers can be integrated as well. In
            case that a third-party driver doesn’t exist for LBaaS V2 installing LBaaS V1 instead of
            V2 is supported.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For more information, see: <xref href="networking/lbaas_admin.dita">Load Balancer
                (LBaaS) Configuration</xref></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>FWaaS (FireWall-as-a-Service) is a Neutron extension that introduces a firewall feature
            set. The included reference implementation is using iptables to block traffic but
            third-party Firewalls can be integrated with this extension into HP Helion OpenStack as
            well.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For more information, see: <xref href="networking/fwaas.dita">Firewall (FWaaS)
                Configuration</xref></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>VPNaaS (Virtual-Private-Network-as-a-Service) is a Neutron extension that introduces a
            vpn feature set. It allows for encrypted traffic between two routers in (potentially)
            different datacenters hence supporting secure multi Availability Zone architectures for
            customers.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For more information, see: <xref href="networking/vpnaas.dita">VPNaaS
                Configuration</xref></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Multiple networks is a feature in HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 that enables bridging of
            multiple external physical networks to neutron network. Using this functionality a
            tenant can dictate the path taken by the data in the physical network outside the cloud.
            It can also be used for multi-homing to two physical networks.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For more information, see: <xref href="networking/multinetwork.dita">Multiple
                External Network Configuration</xref></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>New Network Configuration Options</b></p><ul>
        <li>Network interface (NIC) bonding with multiple modes will allow you to set up a highly
          available and performant network infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Multi-network support will allow you to bridge multiple external physical networks to a
          Neutron network. This will enable you to dictate the path taken by the data in the
          physical network outside of your cloud deployment.</li>
        <li>Network separation (both physical and VLAN) will allow you to segregate traffic by type.
          For example, traffic can be separated into management, tenant, external, and services
          neworks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>NIC Mapping Feature</b></p>
      <p>The new NIC mappings feature in HP Helion OpenStack Beta 2 allows the cloud administrator
        to map network interface names to PCI bus addresses. This is important because for
        well-understood reasons, Linux can sometimes name the network interfaces in a pseudo-random
        order. So in a cluster of identical machines, the <b>eth3</b> device can appear as
          <b>eth4</b> on one or more machines in the cluster. Once this erroneous name is determined
        by the operating system, it will use persistence rules to ensure that the NIC device is
        called <b>eth4</b> thereafter. This makes cluster configuration using Helion quite difficult
        if not impossible, if most machines understand the Management Network to be <b>eth3</b>, but
        some subset of machines understand that network to be on <b>eth4</b>( and whatever was on
        eth4 is similarly swapped to <b>eth3</b>).</p>
      <p>To resolve this, and to ensure that all NIC devices have consistent naming across the
        entire cloud, Beta 2 includes NIC Mapping facilities. This is a mechanism in the Input Model
        to define a specific NIC interface for a given PCI address for a given class of machine.
        Generally, when all of the network interfaces are defined in the <xref
          href="input_model.dita#input_model/4.8_NICMappings" type="section">Input Model</xref>, it
        is advisable to use the traditional naming, ie <b>ethN</b>. However, if one or more
        interfaces are not defined in the Input Model (perhaps because the Ansible network is not
        defined, or because there is a customer-specific network which is outside the scope of
        Helion), then it is recommended that a different naming convention is used, to prevent the
        definitions from colliding with existing configuration data. For example, the NIC mapping
        definitions could use <b>hos0</b>through <b>hosN</b> rather than <b>eth0</b> through
          <b>ethN</b>. Bearing in mind that the new naming must be consistent across the entire
        Input Model.</p>
      <p><b>Monasca-based Monitoring</b></p>
      <p>Monasca is a multi-tenant, scalable, fault-tolerant, monitoring service. It uses a REST API
        for high-speed metrics processing and querying, and has a streaming alarm and notification
        engine. In the HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 release, the OpenStack monitoring standard, Monasca,
        is supported as the HP Helion OpenStack monitoring solution with the following exceptions
        (which are not implemented):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transform Engine</li>
        <li>Events Engine </li>
        <li>Anomaly and Prediction Engine</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Monitoring is integrated for the following services: Logging, Neutron, Swift, Ceilometer,
        Heat, Rabbit, MySQL, HA Proxy, Glance, Cinder, Monitoring of Monasca, Nova, HP Linux for HP
        Helion OpenStack.</p><p>Learn more about Monasca here: <xref
          href="operations/monitoring_service.dita">Monasca Overview</xref></p>
      <p><b>Monitoring Configuration Options Available for Metrics Database</b></p>
      <p>In Beta 2 you will have the option to specify which database platform you want to use for
        the Metrics Database. The default option with the installation is Vertica. The opensource
        alternative is InfluxDB.</p>
      <p>Learn more about these options here: <xref href="administration/configure_monitoring.dita"
          >Configuring the Monitoring Service</xref></p>
      <p><b>Centralized Logging</b></p>
      <p>Logging for the services below is enabled in the default configuration. You will have the
        ability to disable per-service logging as needed.</p>
      <p>Logging is integrated for the following services: Nova, Glance, Swift, Neutron, Ceilometer,
        Monasca, Horizon, Keystone, Cinder, Heat, OpsConsole, DNSaaS, LBaaS, FWaaS, and Trove.</p>

      <p>The default Elasticsearch cluster name is set to <codeph>elasticsearch</codeph> in the
        Logging configuration files. It is necessary during installation to change this value to a
        unique name. This step is included in our installation documentation.</p>
      <p><b>Issue: Logrotate Settings for MySQL, keepalived, and RabbitMQ are Invalid</b></p>
      <p>There is currently a workaround needed on the controller nodes to fix the logrotate
        settings for the MySQL, keepalived, and RabbitMQ services.</p>
      <p>The logrotate for MySQL, keepalived and RabbitMQ is being overwritten by an invalid
        logrotate configuration supplied in the logging-server component. A valid logrotate
        configuration for these services is supplied in the following files on the deployer:</p>
      <codeblock>/home/stack/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible</codeblock>
      <p>The files in that directory are:</p>
      <codeblock>
mysql: ./roles/FND-MDB/templates/etc/logrotate.d/mysql
keepalived: ./roles/keepalived/templates/keepalived.logrotate.j2
rabbit: ./roles/rabbitmq/templates/rabbitmq-server.logrotate.j2</codeblock>
      <p>To correct this problem if the above configuration is copied manually into
          <codeph>/etc/logrotate.d</codeph> on the controller nodes to replace the existing
        configuration then this should correct the logrotate configuration for these services.</p>
      <p>Note any variables such as <codeph>{{ }}</codeph> need to be replaced correctly.</p>
      <p>In the case of RabbitMQ and keepalived this can be achieved by editing the
          <codeph>logrotate.j2</codeph> with a comment and running a reconfigure
        (rabbitmq-reconfigure.yml and FND-CLU-reconfigure.yml on the deployer)</p>
      <p>In the case of MySQL this needs to be corrected manually as below: <codeblock>File ./roles/FND-MDB/templates/etc/logrotate.d/mysql</codeblock>
        <codeblock>

          rotate 7
          missingok

          compress
          delaycompress

          postrotate
                  if test -x /usr/bin/mysqladmin &#38;&#38; \
                     /usr/bin/mysqladmin ping &#38;>/dev/null
                  then

      <p><b>Issue: Unable to Launch Instance from Volume on Horizon Dashboard</b></p>
      <p>In Beta 2 you will not be able to launch an instance from a volume in Horizon. To work
        around this issue you have two options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>From Horizon Dashboard | Instances page: Launch an Instance and select source as
          Bootable volume.</li>
        <li>Use the OpenStack or Nova client to create the instance.</li>
      </ul>
      <note>When using the Launch Instance action in the Volumes table, the Launch Instance Wizard
        form doesn't get pre-populated with the Volumes option selected, nor does it select the
        given Volume.</note>
