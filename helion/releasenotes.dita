    <note type="warning">Be advised that this document has not yet been fully updated for GA</note>
    <p>This document provides an overview of the features contained within HP Helion <tm
        tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> 2.0, including known issues and workarounds for this
      release:</p>

    <section id="Features">
      <p><b>New GUI Installer</b></p>
      <p>HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 introduces a GUI installer for configuring and installing the
        operating system, the cloud, and OpenStack services. It provides an easy way to populate the
        configuration files needed to define the <xref href="input_model.dita">Input Model</xref>,
        and uses them to configure and install your cloud. For help using the installer, see the
        page <xref href="gui_installer.dita"/>.</p>
      <p><b>Transport Layer Security (TLS) Support</b>
      </p><p>TLS is now supported for public endpoints. See <xref
          href="security/tls.dita#topic_yym_nps_4t">Enabling TLS for Public Endpoints</xref> for
        more information.</p>
      <p><b>Encryption of sensitive data</b></p>
      <p>In this release, connection details and passwords are encrypted and or protected. See <xref
          href="security/encrypted_storage.dita">Encryption of Passwords and Sensitive Data
        </xref>for more information.</p>
      <p><b>AppArmor enabled</b></p>
      <p>AppArmor in HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 is installed and enabled on the KVM compute nodes by
        default. It runs in enforce mode. It enforces mandatory access control policies for the
        libvirt process. See <xref href="security/using_apparmor.dita#topic_rmq_j1v_4t">AppArmor in
          HP Helion OpenStack 2.0</xref> for more information.</p>
      <p><b>The lifecycle manager only supports American English language</b></p>
      <p>The lifecycle-manager installation process prompts you to select a language. The only
        supported language at this time is American English.</p>
      <p><b>Local Git repository for config tracking</b></p>
      <p>In HP Helion OpenStack 2.0, a local git repository is used to track configuration changes
        as well as acting as a repository for the Configuration Processor to gather configuration
        settings from. The operations work as explained below: <ul>
          <li>Operations under <codeph>~/helion</codeph> are under the aegis of git. You’ll need to
            commit any config into git (on the "site" branch) before the Configuration Processor can
            run it. The script that runs the config processor now guards against uncommitted
            changes.</li>
          <li>Deployment operations are run from a scratch directory that's assembled from various
            parts (the ansible output of the Configuration Processor and the playbooks). The
            directory is created using <codeph>ready-deployment.yml</codeph>.</li>
          <li>All deployment operations should be run from
              <codeph>~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible</codeph>.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The Configuration Processor uses the config files stored in the repo to apply configuration
        settings. An explanation can be found <xref href="installation/using_git.dita">in this
          topic</xref>.</p>
      <p><b>New UEFI support</b></p>
      <p>HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 includes support for UEFI (which replaces the BIOS on newer
        servers), while continuing to support Legacy BIOS. Select the required mode on each node
        through its BIOS settings before beginning the install process. The installer will detect
        and use the mode you have selected for each node.</p>
      <p><b>Updated HP Helion OpenStack Services</b></p>
      <p>We have included the core set of OpenStack services from the <xref
          href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ReleaseNotes/Kilo" scope="external" format="html"
          >Kilo release</xref> with the exception of limitations notated in this document.</p>
      <p><b>More Cinder Backend Options Available</b></p>
      <p>You can now choose between Ceph, VSA, and 3PAR for Cinder backends.</p>
      <p>See: <xref href="blockstorage/blockstorage_overview.dita">Cinder Overview</xref> for more
        details</p>
      <p><b>Neutron LBaaS and FWaaS Extensions</b></p>
      <p>We have implemented networking extensions for load balancing and firewalls. Here is a
        description of each of these: <ul>
          <li>
            <p>LBaaS (Load-Balancing-as-a-Service) is a Neutron extension that introduces a load
              balancing feature set. HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 includes the V2 version which uses an
              implementation of HA Proxy but third-party load balancers can be integrated as well.
              If a third-party driver doesn’t exist for the load balancer you want to use, then
              LBaaS V2 installing LBaaS V1 instead of V2 is supported.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For more information, see: <xref href="networking/lbaas_admin.dita">Load Balancer
                  (LBaaS) Configuration</xref></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>FWaaS (FireWall-as-a-Service) is a Neutron extension that introduces a firewall
              feature set. The included reference implementation is using iptables to block traffic
              but third-party Firewalls can be integrated with this extension into HP Helion
              OpenStack as well.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For more information, see: <xref href="networking/fwaas.dita">Firewall (FWaaS)
                  Configuration</xref></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>VPNaaS (Virtual-Private-Network-as-a-Service) is a Neutron extension that introduces
              a vpn feature set. It allows for encrypted traffic between two routers in
              (potentially) different datacenters hence supporting secure multi Availability Zone
              architectures for customers.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For more information, see: <xref href="networking/vpnaas.dita">VPNaaS
                  Configuration</xref></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Multiple networks is a feature in HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 that enables bridging of
              multiple external physical networks to Neutron network. Using this functionality a
              tenant can dictate the path taken by the data in the physical network outside the
              cloud. It can also be used for multi-homing to two physical networks.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For more information, see: <xref href="networking/multinetwork.dita">Multiple
                  External Network Configuration</xref></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><b>New Network Configuration Options</b></p><ul>
        <li>Network interface (NIC) bonding with multiple modes will allow you to set up a highly
          available and performant network infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Multi-network support will allow you to bridge multiple external physical networks to a
          Neutron network. This will enable you to dictate the path taken by the data in the
          physical network outside of your cloud deployment.</li>
        <li>Network separation (both physical and VLAN) will allow you to segregate traffic by type.
          For example, traffic can be separated into management, tenant, external, and service
          networks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>NIC Mapping Feature</b></p> The new NIC mappings feature in HP Helion OpenStack allows
      the cloud administrator to map network interface names to PCI bus addresses. This is important
      because for well-understood reasons, Linux can sometimes name the network interfaces in a
      pseudo-random order. So in a cluster of identical machines, the <b>eth3</b> device can appear
      as <b>eth4</b> on one or more machines in the cluster. Once this erroneous name is determined
      by the operating system, it will use persistence rules to ensure that the NIC device is called
        <b>eth4</b> thereafter. This makes cluster configuration using Helion quite difficult if not
      impossible, if most machines understand the Management Network to be <b>eth3</b>, but some
      subset of machines understand that network to be on <b>eth4</b> ( and whatever was on eth4 is
      similarly swapped to <b>eth3</b>). <p>To resolve this, and to ensure that all NIC devices have
        consistent naming across the entire cloud, HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 includes NIC Mapping
        facilities. This is a mechanism in the Input Model to define a specific NIC interface for a
        given PCI address for a given class of machine. Generally, when all of the network
        interfaces are defined in the <xref href="input_model.dita#input_model/co_nicmappings"
          type="section">Input Model</xref>, it is advisable to use the traditional naming, ie
          <b>ethN</b>. However, if one or more interfaces are not defined in the Input Model
        (perhaps because the Ansible network is not defined, or because there is a customer-specific
        network which is outside the scope of Helion), then it is recommended that a different
        naming convention is used, to prevent the definitions from colliding with existing
        configuration data. For example, the NIC mapping definitions could use <b>hos0</b> through
          <b>hosN</b> rather than <b>eth0</b> through <b>ethN</b>, bearing in mind that the new
        naming must be consistent across the entire Input Model.</p>
      <p><b>Monasca-based Monitoring</b></p><p>Monasca is a multi-tenant, scalable, fault-tolerant,
        monitoring service. It uses a REST API for high-speed metrics processing and querying, and
        has a streaming alarm and notification engine. In the HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 release, the
        OpenStack monitoring standard, Monasca, is supported as the HP Helion OpenStack monitoring
        solution with the following exceptions (which are not implemented):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transform Engine</li>
        <li>Events Engine </li>
        <li>Anomaly and Prediction Engine</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Monitoring is integrated for the following services: Logging, Neutron, Swift, Ceilometer,
        Heat, Rabbit, MySQL, HA Proxy, Glance, Cinder, Monitoring of Monasca, Nova, HP Linux for HP
        Helion OpenStack.</p><p>Learn more about Monasca here: <xref
          href="operations/monitoring_service.dita">Monasca Overview</xref></p>
      <p><b>Monitoring Configuration Options Available for Metrics Database</b></p><p>In this
        release you will have the option to specify which database platform you want to use for the
        metrics database. The default option with the installation is Vertica. The opensource
        alternative is InfluxDB.</p> Learn more about these options here: <xref
        href="administration/configure_monitoring.dita">Configuring the Monitoring Service</xref>
      <p><b>Centralized Logging</b></p> Logging for the services below is enabled in the default
      configuration. You will have the ability to disable per-service logging as needed. <p>Logging
        is integrated for the following services: Nova, Glance, Swift, Neutron, Ceilometer, Monasca,
        Horizon, Keystone, Cinder, Heat, OpsConsole, DNSaaS, LBaaS, FWaaS, and Trove.</p><p>Learn

    <section id="KnownIssues">
      <title>Limitations in this Release</title><p><b>Installing Swift</b></p><p>Swift installs with
        the following limitations: </p><ul id="ul_p21_d45_tt">
        <li>Only one Swift zone is supported.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Monitoring (Monasca) Limitations</b></p> The monitoring service has the following
      limitations: <ul id="ul_fn1_d45_tt">
        <li>Vertica is the default metrics database option in the install. If you want to use
          InfluxDB then read <xref
            href="administration/configure_monitoring.dita#configure_monitoring/config"
            type="section">Configuring Monasca</xref> for more details.</li>
        <li>InfluxDB is not configured behind a VIP. It must directly access one node in the
          cluster.</li>
        <li>Backup/restore of Monasca configuration and metrics data is not available.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Issue: Monasca Command-line Client (CLI) Redirect Fails</b></p>
      <p>If you are using the Monasca CLI and you receive the error below, we have included a
        workaround:</p>
      <p>Error:
        <codeblock>$ monasca metric-list|grep hostname
'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 1058218-1058219: ordinal not in range(128)</codeblock></p>
      <p>Workaround:
        <codeblock>PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 monasca metric-list | grep hostname</codeblock></p>
      <p><b>Monasca Forwarder Log Reporting False Errors</b></p>
      <p>There is an issue where the <codeph>/var/log/monasca/agent/forwarder.log</codeph> log file
        will contain many lines containing text like this:</p>
      <codeblock>2015-09-23 17:33:34 UTC | ERROR | forwarder |
monascaclient.exc(exc.py:60) | exception: Authentication failed.</codeblock>
      <p>This is due to an issue where the monasca-agent is attempting to authenticate when it's
        token has expired. These can be ignored.</p>
      <p><b>Issue: The 'Cinderlm diagnostics monitor' alarm alerts with an 'UNDETERMINED'
        state</b></p>
      <p>This alert is not always reported but may occur after the system has been running for some
        time.</p>
      <p>Check if any other Cinder related alarms are alerting. If no other other Cinder related
        alarms are alerting then this alert for the Cinderlm diagnostics monitor alarm can be
        ignored. If other Cinder related alarms are alerting then follow the mitigation steps
        described in the Service Alarm Definitions section.</p>
      <p><b>Operations Console (Ops Console)</b></p> The Operations Console has the following

      <p>The Operations Console UI does not support >10,000 simultaneous alarm instances.
        Configuring alarm definitions such that the number of alarms instances exceeeds the 10,000
        mark may cause some alarms to not show in the UI. The workaround for this issue is to access
        those alarms via either the API or the command-line clients.</p>
      <p id="logging"><b>Centralized Logging Limitations</b></p>
      <p>The Centralized Logging service has the following limitations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alarm definition and generation for Kibana and curator are not integrated.</li>
        <li>Logging-monitor 'stop' playbook is not integrated.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Issue: The Elasticsearch Cluster Name Must Be Unique</b></p>
      <p>The default Elasticsearch cluster name is set to <codeph>elasticsearch</codeph> in the
        logging configuration files. It is necessary during installation to change this value to a
        unique name. This step is included in our installation documentation.</p>
      <p><b>The Elasticsearch high/low watermark alarms will show up in "Undefined"</b></p>
      <p>In the Operations Console, the Elasticsearch high/low watermark alarms will show up in the
        “Undefined” section instead of in the "Logging" section.</p>
      <p><b>Issue: The Heap parameters for Elasticsearch and Logstash are auto-tuned
        incorrectly</b></p>
      <p>There is an issue where the Heap parameters for Elasticsearch and Logstash are incorrectly
        auto-tuned. The default values are listed in <xref
          href="administration/configure_logging.dita#configure_logging/general_config">Configuring
          the Centralized Logging Service</xref>. There is a bug where Ansible is reporting the
        memory values incorrectly as values that are slightly less than what they actually are. So,
        for example, if you have 32GB of RAM you should fall into the "Small" auto-tuning category
        but because of this incorrectly reported value you are actually falling into the "Demo"
        category. We recommend that you manually modify the heap values on the lifecycle-manager
        node for systems with the specified amount of RAM in the table below to the values listed.
        You will edit these values in the <codeph>logging_possible_tunings</codeph> section of the
        file below:</p>

      <p><b>Issue: Logrotate Settings for MySQL, keepalived, and RabbitMQ are Invalid</b></p>
      <p>There is currently a workaround needed on the controller nodes to fix the logrotate
        settings for the MySQL, keepalived, and RabbitMQ services.</p> The logrotate for MySQL,
      keepalived and RabbitMQ is being overwritten by an invalid logrotate configuration supplied in
      the logging-server component. A valid logrotate configuration for these services is supplied
      in the following files on the deployer:
        <codeblock>/home/stack/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible</codeblock><p>The files in that
        directory are:</p><codeblock>
mysql: ./roles/FND-MDB/templates/etc/logrotate.d/mysql
keepalived: ./roles/keepalived/templates/keepalived.logrotate.j2
rabbit: ./roles/rabbitmq/templates/rabbitmq-server.logrotate.j2</codeblock>
      <p>To correct this problem if the above configuration is copied manually into
          <codeph>/etc/logrotate.d</codeph> on the controller nodes to replace the existing
        configuration then this should correct the logrotate configuration for these
        services.</p><p>Note any variables such as <codeph>{{ }}</codeph> need to be replaced
        correctly.</p> In the case of RabbitMQ and keepalived this can be achieved by editing the
        <codeph>logrotate.j2</codeph> with a comment and running a reconfigure
      (rabbitmq-reconfigure.yml and FND-CLU-reconfigure.yml on the deployer) <p>In the case of MySQL
        this needs to be corrected manually as below: <codeblock>File ./roles/FND-MDB/templates/etc/logrotate.d/mysql</codeblock>

      <p><b>Issue: Unable to Launch Instance from Volume on Horizon Dashboard</b></p><p>In Beta 2
        you will not be able to launch an instance from a volume in Horizon. To work around this
        issue you have two options:</p>
      <ul id="ul_vrb_d45_tt">
        <li>From Horizon Dashboard | Instances page: Launch an Instance and select source as
          Bootable volume.</li>
        <li>Use the OpenStack or Nova client to create the instance.</li>
      </ul>
      <note>When using the Launch Instance action in the Volumes table, the Launch Instance Wizard
        form doesn't get pre-populated with the Volumes option selected, nor does it select the
        given Volume.</note>
      <p><b>Issue: The <codeph>Start Instances</codeph> Option is Available In Horizon for Instances
          that are Already Started</b></p>
      <p>There is currently an OpenStack bug where the <codeph>Start Instances</codeph> option is
        available in the instance action drop-down even if your instances are already in an Active
        state.</p>
      <p><b>Restarting lifecycle-manager node leaves Apache2 down</b></p>
      <p>If you restart your Deployer/lifecycle management node, note that Apache2 will not restart
        on its own. You will need to restart it manually.</p>
      <b>Heat autoscaling not supported </b>
      <p>In HP Helion OpenStack 2.0, the auto-scaling in Heat is not supported because the alarm
        creation in Ceilometer is disabled.</p>
      <b>A Horizon create a 'bootable volume' fails UI task</b>
      <p>When you navigate to 'volumes' and choose to create a 'bootable volume,' if you do not
        navigate elsewhere, the attempt to launch an instance from that volume will fail. That is,
        nothing will happen.</p><p> To work around this issue, after choosing to create a 'bootable
        volume,' refresh the page in the browser and then proceed. </p>
      <b>Moonshot remote console goes blank after operating system install</b>
      <p>If you are using Moonshot compute nodes you may find that their remote console is blank or
        garbled after the OS install. If affected, you need to make the following change to
        /etc/default/grub on each affected node, run update-grub and reboot:</p><ol
        id="ol_p1c_d45_tt">
        <li>Find the line starting with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX= </li>
        <li>Add the following at the end of the value i.e. inside the double quotes:
          <codeblock>vga=788 console=ttyS0,9600 earlyprint=serial,ttyS0,9600</codeblock>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <b>IPv6 Traffic Not Supported</b>
      <p>The HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 release includes firewall rules to prevent non-essential
        traffic from accessing the physical systems. However, these rules are limited to IPv4
        traffic only. In order to prevent unsolicited or nefarious IPv6 traffic, you will need to
        block IPv6 at your router, or within the infrastructure.</p><p> You can disable IPv6 on your
        operating systems by adding the following lines to <b>/etc/sysctl.conf</b>:
        <codeblock>net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1</codeblock>
        Once these have been added, you can either reboot the node or run the following command (as
        root): <codeblock># sysctl -p</codeblock> Please refer to your router documentation to block
        IPv6 traffic from reaching your network at the router.</p></section>

      associated stack from the softlockup will show the instruction point either holding or
      attempting to acquire a spinlock. After all the LUNs have successfully detached and the
      devices have been flushed, the messages will subside. It is recommended that you include a
      delay when detaching multiple LUNs to avoid the softlockup and RCU stall messages. </section>

        included in Helion standard product support. </p>
      <p>Non-core services (listed in the Features tables below) are provided as-is. Some non-core
        services are included in this release to provide early access to features that HPE may
        support fully in future releases, but HPE cannot guarantee that support will be provided or
        issues resolved in a future release. Other non-core features are provided in this release
        for a limited time and may be deprecated in future releases. HPE will attempt to provide
        guidance and telephone support for these features at its discretion. If you need additional
        support on any of these features for a specific use case, please contact the Helion
        professional services team. </p>
