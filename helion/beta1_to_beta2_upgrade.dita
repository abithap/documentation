  <title>Upgrading from Beta1 to Beta2</title>
  <body>
    <p> Upgrade from Beta1 to Beta2 is now supported. To preform the upgrade, yu must have a working
      deployment of the Beta1 release. </p>
    <p>To perform the upgrade, follow the steps below. The upgrade will apply necessary changes to
      HP Helion OpenStack services, as well as to the underlying cloud platform. OS kernel updates
      are not performed at this time.<ol id="ol_kyd_rxz_jt">
        <li>Log in to the deployer node as the user you created during the beta1 deployment, and
          mount the beta2 install media at /media/cdrom, for example:
          <codeblock>sudo mount hLinux-cattleprod-amd64-blaster-netinst-20150901-hlm.&lt;build-date_sha1>.iso /media/cdrom</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li> Unpack the following tarball: Note this file name will change (NOTE: the new release is
          still called beta1, change is pending):
          <codeblock>tar zxvf /media/cdrom/hos-2.0.0/hos-2.0.0-b.1-20150908T154315Z.tgz</codeblock>
          Run the included initialisation script to update the deployer (NOTE: the new release is
          still called beta1, change is pending):
          <codeblock>  ~/hos-2.0.0-b.1/hos-init.bash</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the new Ansible tree for the upgrade task: <ol id="ol_zzd_rxz_jt">
            <li> Resolve any merge conflicts that may have arisen:
              <codeblock>cd ~/helion
        git status
        etc. etc.</codeblock></li>
            <li> Run the config processor:
              <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible/
        ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml</codeblock>
            </li>
            <li>Run the ready deployment script:
              <codeblock>ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock>
            </li>
          </ol></li>
        <li>Run the upgrade playbook:
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
        ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-upgrade.yml</codeblock>
        </li>
      </ol>
