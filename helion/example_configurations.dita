  <title>Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> 2.0: Example Configurations</title>
  <body>
    <p>The HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 system ships with a number of pre-qualified example
      configuration. These are designed to help you to get up and running quickly with a minimum
      number of configuration changes.</p>
    <p>The HP Helion OpenStack input model allows a wide variety of configuration parameters that
      may, at first glance, appear daunting. The example configurations are designed to simplify
      this process by providing pre-built and pre-qualified examples that need only a minimum number
      of modifications to get started.</p>
    <p>This section briefly describes the various example configuration and their capabilities. It
      also describes in detail (for one of the examples, entry-scale-kvm-vsa), how you may adapt the
      input model to work in your environment.</p>
