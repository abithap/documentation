  <title>Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> 2.0: Example Configurations</title>
  <body>
    <p>The HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 system ships with a number of pre-qualified example
      configuration. These are designed to help you to get up and running quickly with a minimum
      number of configuration changes.</p>
    <p>The HP Helion OpenStack input model allows a wide variety of configuration parameters that
      may, at first glance, appear daunting. The example configurations are designed to simplify
      this process by providing pre-built and pre-qualified examples that need only a minimum number
      of modifications to get started.</p>
    <p>This section briefly describes the various example configuration and their capabilities. It
      also describes in detail (for one of the examples, entry-scale-kvm-vsa), how you may adapt the
      input model to work in your environment.</p>
    <p>HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 ships with two classes of sample cloud models: examples and
      tech-preview. The models in the examples directory have been qualified by our Quality
      Engineering team, whilst the tech-preview models are more experimental.</p>
    <p>The following pre-qualified examples are shipped with HP Helion OpenStack 2.0:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Entry-scale KVM with VSA model (entry-scale-kvm-vsa)</li>
      <li>Entry-scale Swift Only model (entry-scale-swift)</li>
      <li>Entry-scale KVM with Ceph model (entry-scale-kvm-ceph)</li>
      <li>Entry-scale ESX model (entry-scale-esx)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These systems are designed to provide an entry-level solution that can be scaled from a small
      number of nodes to a moderately high node count (approximately 100 compute nodes, for
      example).</p>
    <p>The tech-preview configuration include the following model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mid-scale KVM with VSA model (mid-scale-kvm-vsa): In this model, the cloud control plane
        is subdivided into a number of dedicated service clusters to provide more processing power
        for individual control plane elements. This enables a greater number of resources to be
        supported (compute nodes, Swift object servers). This model also shows how a segmented
        network can be expressed in the HP Helion OpenStack model.</li>
    </ul>
    <section id="2.1_entryscale_kvm_vsa"><title>Entry-scale KVM with VSA model</title>
      <p>This model provides a KVM-based cloud with VSA for volume storage, and has been tested to a
        scale of 100 compute nodes.</p>
      <p>The example is focused on the minimum server count to support a highly-available (HA)
        compute cloud deployment. The first (manually installed) server, often referred to as the
        deployer, is also used as one of the controller nodes. This model consists of a minimum
        server count of seven, with three controllers, three VSA storage servers, and one compute
        server. Swift storage in this example is contained on the controllers.</p>
      <p>Note that the VSA storage requires a minimum of three servers for a HA configuration,
        although the deployment will work with as little as one VSA node.</p>
      <p>This model can also be deployed without the VSA servers and configured to use an external
        storage device, such as a 3PAR array, which would reduce the minimum server count to
        four.</p>
      <!-- MEDIA DIAGRAM GOES HERE -->
      <p>The example requires the following networks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>External API</b> - This is the network that users will use to make requests to the
          cloud.</li>
        <li><b>External VM</b> - This is the network that will be used to provide access to virtual
          machines (via floating IP addresses)</li>
        <li><b>Guest/VxLAN</b> - This is the network that will carry traffic between virtual
          machines on private networks within the cloud</li>
        <li><b>Management</b> - This is the netwrok that will be used for all internal traffic
          between the cloud services, including node provisioning. This network must be on an
          untagged VLAN.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of these networks are configured to be presented via a pair of bonded NICs. The example
        also enables provider VLANs to be configured in Neutron on this interface.</p>
      <p>In the diagram, "External Routing" refers to whatever routing you want to provide to allow
        users to access the External API and External VM networks. Note that the EXTERNAL_API
        network must be reachable from the EXTERNAL_VM network if you want virtual machines to be
        able to make API calls to the cloud. "Internal Routing" refers to whatever routing you want
        to provide to allow administrators to access the Management network.</p>
      <p>If you are using HP Helion OpenStack to install the operating system, then an IPMI/iLO
        network connected to the IPMI/iLO ports of all servers and routable from the deployer server
        is also required for BIOS and power management of the nodes during the operating system
        installation process.</p>
      <p>The example uses the following disk configurations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Controllers</b> - One operating system disk and two disks for Swift storage</li>
        <li><b>VSA</b> - one operating system disk and two disks for VSA storage</li>
        <li><b>Compute</b> - one operating system disk and one disk for virtual machine ephemeral
          storage</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="2.2_entryscale_esx"><title>Entry-scale ESX model</title>
      <p>This example shows how to integrate HP Helion OpenStack with ESX. The controller
        configuration is essentially the same as in the KVM example, but the resource nodes are
        provided by vCenter. In addition, a number of controller virtual machines are created for
        each vCenter Cluster; One ESX Compute VM (which provides the nova-compute proxy for vCenter)
        and one OVSvApp VM per cluster member (which provides network access). These virtual
        machines are created automatically by HP Helion OpenStack as part of activating the vCenter
        Cluster, and are therefore not defined in the example.</p>
