  <title>HP Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> 2.0: Applying Input Model Changes to Existing
    Rings</title>
  <body>
    <p>This section describes a general approach of making changes to the existing rings. This
      applies to actions such as adding and removing a server and replacing and upgrading the disk
      drive(s). There are a number of phases that must be performed when adding and removing a
      server and replacing and upgrading the disk drive(s), as shown below:</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_sqz_jft_4t">
        <li><b>Changing the Input Model Phase</b><p>Do the following:<ol id="ol_jv2_zf5_pt">
              <li>If not already done, set the weight-step attribute. (See <xref
                  href="preparing_ring_changes.dita#topic_t1y_vjs_4t/setting-weight-step-attribute"
                  >Setting the weight-step attribute</xref>). </li>
              <li>Edit the Input Model as appropriate. You must edit the YAML file as per your
                requirement. For more information, refer <xref
                  href="../input_model.dita#input_model"/></li>
              <li>Commit your configuration to the <xref href="../using_git.dita">local repo</xref>,
                as follows:<codeblock>git add -A
git commit -m "commit message"</codeblock></li>
              <li>Run the configuration
                processor:<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml</codeblock></li>
              <li>Run the following command to create a deployment
                directory.<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock></li>
              <li>Run the following
                playbook.<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible/
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost _swift-validate-input-model.yml</codeblock></li>
              <li>Validate that the number of drives proposed to be added or deleted or weight
                change is correct. Fix any errors in your input model. At this stage, no changes
                have been made to rings. </li>
            </ol></p></li>
        <li><b>First phase of ring rebalance:</b><p>Do the following:<ol id="ol_f5m_dg5_pt">
              <li>Apply the input model changes to the rings, rebalance the rings and deploy them to
                all Swift nodes by running the following
                playbook:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-deploy.yml </codeblock></li>
              <li>Wait until replication has finished or min-part-time has elapsed (which ever is
                longer). For more information see <xref
                  href="safe_rebalance_deploy_ring.dita#topic_ohx_j1t_4t"/></li>
            </ol></p></li>
        <li><b>Weight change phase of ring rebalance:</b><p>At this stage, no changes are being made
            to the input model. However, when you set the weight-step attribute, the rings that was
            rebuilt in the previous rebalance phase have weights that are different than their
            target/final value. You gradually move to the target/final weight by rebalancing a
            number of times as described in this page. For more information about the weight-step
            attribute see <xref href="preparing_ring_changes.dita#topic_t1y_vjs_4t">Swift preparing
              ring changes</xref>.</p><p>Do the following:<ol id="ol_vyc_gg5_pt">
              <li>Rebalance the rings by running the following
                playbook:<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible/

                <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible/
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost _swift-validate-input-model.yml</codeblock>and
                examine the report.<p>An example of the output after executing the above command. In
                  the example  <b>no</b> weight changes are

        ]
    }

              <li>When there are no proposed weight changes, you proceed the final phase.</li>
              <li>If there are proposed weight changes repeat this phase again. </li>
            </ol></p></li>
        <li><b>Final rebalance phase:</b><p>The final rebalance phase moves all replicas to their
            final destination.<ol id="ol_nlx_3g5_pt">
              <li>Rebalance the rings by running the following playbook.
                  <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible/

                  output is saved for later examination.</note></li>
              <li>Examine the output from the previous step. If the output for all ring is similar
                to the following, the rebalance had no effect. That is, the rings are  balanced and
                no further changes are needed. In addition, the ring files were not changed so you
                do not need to deploy them to the Swift
                  nodes.<codeblock>"Running: swift-ring-builder /etc/swiftlm/builder_dir/region-region1/account.builder rebalance 999",

                  text <b>No partitions could be reassigned</b> indicates that no further rebalances
                  are necessary. If this is true for all the rings, you have completed the final
                    phase.<note>You must have allowed enough time to elapse since the last
                    rebalance. As mentioned in the above example, <codeph>min_part_hours
                      [16]</codeph> means that you must wait at least 16 hours since the last
                    rebalance. If not, you should wait until enough time has elapsed and repeat this
                    phase.</note></p></li>

                it from the ring â€“ this creates to operator overhead. Swift will continue to store
                the correct number of replicas by "handing off" objects to other drives instead of
                the failed drive.</p>If the disk drives are of the same size as the original when
              the drive is replaced, no ring changes are required. You can confirm this by running
              the <codeph>_swift-make-delta-rebalance.yml</codeph> playbook. It should report that
              no weight changes are needed. <p>For a single drive replacement, even if the drive is
                significantly larger than the original drives then you do not need to rebalance the
                ring (however, the extra space on the drive will not be used).</p></stentry>

              <p>If the drives are different size (for example, you are upgrading your system), you
                can proceed as follows:</p>
              <ul id="ul_smv_pfz_4t">
                <li>If not already done, set the weight-step attribute</li>

                    <li>Avoid replacing too many drives at once.</li>
                    <li>If your rings use swift zones, upgrade a number of drives in the same zone
                      at the same time â€“ not drives in several zones.</li>
                    <li>It is also safer to upgrade one server instead of drives in several servers
                      at the same time.</li>
                    <li>Remember that the final size of all Swift zones must be the same, so you may
                      need to replace a small number of drives in one zone, then a small number in
                      second zone, then return to the first zone and replace more drives, etc. </li>
                  </ul></li>
