  <title>Allocating Proxy, Account, Container (PAC) Servers</title>
  <body>
    <p>A proxy, account, and container (PAC) server is a node that runs the swift-proxy,
      swift-account and swift-container services. It is used to respond to API requests and to store
      account and container data. The PAC node does not store an Object data.</p>
    <p>This section describes the procedure to allocate Proxy, Account, Container (PAC) Servers
      during the <b>initial</b> deployment of the system. </p>
    <section>
      <title>Procedure to allocate Swift PAC Servers</title>
      <p>Perform the following steps to allocate PAC Servers:</p>
    </section>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify if the example input model already contains a suitable server role. The server
        roles are usually described in <codeph>data/server_roles.yml</codeph> file. If the server
        role is not described, you must add a suitable server role as described in <i><xref
            href="creating_roles_swift_nodes.dita">Creating Role for Swift Nodes</xref></i>. As part
        of this process you will also allocate drives to store object data as described in <i><xref
            href="allocating_disk_drives.dita">Allocating Disk Drives.</xref></i></li>
      <li>Verify if the example input model has assigned a cluster to Swift proxy, account,
        container servers. It is usually mentioned in <codeph>data/control_plane.yml</codeph> file.
        If the cluster is not assigned then add a suitable cluster as described in <i><xref
            href="creating_pac_cluster.dita">Creating an Proxy, Account, Container
          Cluster.</xref></i></li>
      <li>Identity the physical servers and their IP address and other detailed information.<ul
          id="ul_tzf_pqb_jt">
          <li>You add these details to the servers list (usually in
              <codeph>data/servers.yml</codeph> file).</li>
          <li>As with all servers, you must also verify and/or modify the server-groups information
            (usually in <codeph>data/server_groups.yml</codeph>)</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The only part of this process that is unique to Swift is the allocation of disk drives for
      use by the object ring as described in <i><xref
          href="allocating_disk_drives.dita#allocating-disk-drives">Allocating Disk
        Drives.</xref></i></p>
