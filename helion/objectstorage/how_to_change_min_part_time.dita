  <title>HP Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> 2.0: How to Change min-part-time</title>
  <body><!--Needs Edit-->
    <p>The following procedures allow you to change the min-part-time.</p>
    <p>
      <simpletable>
        <strow>
          <stentry><b>Description</b>
          </stentry>
          <stentry>In the cloud model ring-specifications, the min-part-time attribute specifies how
            many hours you must wait between ring rebuilds. If you change the min-part-time
            attribute, this is not reflected in the ring files and it only applies at the time the
            rings are created. </stentry>
        </strow>
        <strow>
          <stentry><b>Resolution</b></stentry>
          <stentry>You can change the values as follows:<ol id="ol_qzp_zhb_kt">
              <li>Log into the first server running the swift-proxy service.</li>
              <li>Go to the <codeph>/etc/swiftlm/builder_dir/region-&lt;region-name></codeph>
                  directory<p>where &lt;region-name> is the region-name field in your cloud model
                  (For example: region1 in most example files). </p></li>
              <li>Search for files with a <codeph>.builder</codeph> extension. </li>
              <li> Run the following command against each builder file. For example, to change the
                value to 16 hours for the account builder file, the command is as follows:
                <codeblock>sudo swift-ring-builder account.builder set_min_part_hours 16</codeblock></li>
              <li> You should also update the ring-specifications (usually in
                  <codeph>data/swift/rings.yml</codeph>) to contain the same value for the
                min-part-time.
                <!--This has no effect in the current release but will have an effect in a future release.--></li>
            </ol></stentry>
        </strow>
      </simpletable>
