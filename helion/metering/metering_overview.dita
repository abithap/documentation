      New Functionality in Helion OpenStack v2.0
      
      The default meters and other items configured for the Ceilometer API can now be modified and additional meters can be added.  It is highly recommended that customers test overall Helion OpenStack performance prior to deploying any Ceilometer modifications to ensure the addition of new notifications or polling events does not negatively affect overall system performance.
      Ceilometer Central Agent (pollster) is now configured to support HA (Active-Active)
      Notification Agent has built-in HA (Active-Active) with support for pipeline transformers
      Ceilometer expirer supports native HA and the ability to expirer sample data instead of all data within the retention period.
      SWIFT Poll-based account level meters will be enabled by default with an hourly collection cycle.
      Flexible configuration for pollster and notifications. We can list different event types differently for these services.
      Integrated with centralized monitoring(Monasca) and centralized logging
      Upgrade and Reconfigure Support
      Limitations
      
      Since Ceilometer is currently deployed with a shared MySQL database only a limited set of metrics are configured by default to ensure overall system availability and performance.
      The default Ceilometer expiry is configured for 7 days.
      The Ceilometer Meter list API is configured to return no more than 20 with an open ended, query sample.
      The Ceilometer Alarms API is disabled by default.  Helion OpenStack v2.0 provides an alternative operations monitoring service that will provide support for operations monitoring, alerts, and notifications use cases.
      The Ceilometer Post Meter API is disabled by default.
      No Talligent Openbook support
      The query sample  API will be disabled and sample-list API can be used as an alternate  solution with limited functionality

   <!-- <note>The deployment of the HP Helion OpenStack Metering service is considered experimental and
      targeted at developers investigating integration of external software applications with the
      Ceilometer API for showback, chargeback, and billing applications only. Only a limited set of
      metrics are available. Developers interested in monitoring use cases should refer to the <xref
        href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Monasca" scope="external" format="html">OpenStack
        Monasca service</xref> and the HP Helion-specific <xref
        href="../operations/monitoring_service.dita">Monasca documentation</xref>.</note>
    <p>The HP Helion OpenStack Metering service leverages the OpenStack Ceilometer service. A
      metering service takes specified measurements of both physical and virtual resources,
      including physical servers and network devices such as switches and firewalls. No matter what
      purpose the data is used for, this service provides a reliable, consistent method for data
      collection.</p>
    <section id="newIn20">
      <title>New for HP Helion OpenStack 2.0</title>
      <p> Ceilometer configuration is now possible via a number of yaml files in the HP Helion
        OpenStack implementation of the OpenStack Ceilometer metering service.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="installation">
      <title>Installation</title>
      <p>The metering service is automatically installed as part of the HP Helion OpenStack
        installation process. It may be necessary to install the command-line interface (<xref
          href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/install_clients.html" scope="external"
          format="html">CLI</xref>) separately to perform various administrative tasks.</p>
      <p>The initial default configuration enables a limited subset of all potential meters,
        collecting a few essential measurements from the Nova, Cinder, Glance, and Neutron services
        only. With these measurements, the Ceilometer API can begin collecting basic HP Helion
        OpenStack usage and status information.</p>
      <p>Additional metrics collection for all of the HP Helion OpenStack infrastructure services,
        as well as other application and platform services, are targeted for future HP Helion
        OpenStack releases.</p>

      <title>Working with Ceilometer</title>
      <p>All the Ceilometer processes have a unified configuration file: ceilometer.conf.</p>
      <p>Access to Ceilometer is through the command-line interface <xref
          href="http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/ceilometerclient_commands.html"
          scope="external" format="html">(CLI)</xref>, or the low-level <xref
          href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-telemetry-v2.html" scope="external"
          format="html">REST API</xref>. A Ceilometer Horizon dashboard panel is not available at
        this time.</p>
