      <b>Domains</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Domains can be created and managed by the Keystone API and OpenStackClient CLI.</li>
        <li>End users can authenticate to a particular project and domain via the Keystone API and
          OpenStackClient CLI.</li>

        <li>The configuration of external authentication systems requires the creation and usage of
          Domains.</li>
        <li>All configurations are managed by creating and editing specific configuration files. </li>
        <li>End users can authenticate to a particular project and domain via the Keystone API and
          OpenStackClient CLI.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Keystone-to-Keystone Federation</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Keystone-to-Keystone (K2K) Federation provides the ability to authenticate once with one
          cloud and then use these credentials to access resources on other federated clouds.</li>
        <li>All configurations are managed by creating and editing specific configuration files. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <b>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The Keystone architecture provides support for MFA deployments.</li>
        <li>MFA provides the ability to deploy non-password based authentication; for example: token
          providing hardware and text messages.</li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <b>Hierarchical Multitenancy</b>
      
      <ul>
        
        <li>Provides the ability to create sub-projects within a Domain-Project hierarchy.</li>
        
        
      </ul>

        <li>No Horizon web portal support currently exists for the creation and management of
          external authentication system configurations.</li>

        <li>A new Domain Admin API has been included in the Kilo release of OpenStack but is
          currently an "experimental" function and is not recommended for production use until a
          future OpenStack release.</li>

      <b>Keystone-to-Keystone Federation</b><ul id="ul_xw2_jpd_bt">
    
     
        <li>No Horizon web portal support currently exists for the creation and management of
          federation configurations.</li>
        <li>All end users authentication is available only via the Keystone API and OpenStackClient
          CLI.</li>
        <li>No current HPE documentation is available for this function.</li>

          Services support.</li>
        <li>MFA drivers are not included with Helion OpenStack and need to be provided by a specific
          MFA vendor.</li>
